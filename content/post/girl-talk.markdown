![ILL3unstopp.JPG](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/ILL3unstopp.JPG)If you're like me you like DJ tracks with disparet samples dropped everywhere over layers of deep beets, the trouble comes when the artist has to clear all of those samples which hinders the artistic output.  This was solved by Danger Mouse on [The Grey Album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grey_Album), by simply NOT clearing any of the samples.  Another DJ with the same mindset (and arguably more originality) is [Girl Talk](http://www.girl-talk.net/).  From the aptly named site [Illegal Art](http://illegalart.net/) that hosts/sells Girl Talk's music, they describe the artist, "_Girl Talk (aka Gregg Gillis) is back with his 3rd album on Illegal Art. With each release getting closer to his notorious semi-naked live show, Night Ripper is focused less on beat-f**kery and more on bringing heat to the party. It bangs as a continuous mix packed with wildly disparate Top 40 _![ILL3113.JPG](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/ILL3113.thumbnail.JPG)_genres and eras. Current hip hop hits, soft rock radio standards, party classics, grunge masterpieces, R&B singles, glossy club-shakers, and rock anthems are all layered and pieced meticulously __together into one non-stop celebration of pop and excess. Only Girl Talk's magical touch could please both dance-crazed teenage masses and mashup geeks with equal love. Mark Hosler of Negativland has declared it “a plunderphonics party record_.” For his latest effort, _Night Ripper_, [Pitchfork gave him an 8.4](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/37357/Girl_Talk_Night_Ripper), a very high score from those wanna be Gong Show judges.  I found some live pics of Girl Talk ripping it up (in only a pair of boxers) in the super-unhip locale of Columbia, MO [here](http://philoblog.blogspot.com/2006_02_01_philoblog_archive.html#114119164870522364), apparently hosted by the creator of Illegal Art. Check the samples below for _Smash Your Head_, _Hold Up_ and _Bounce That_ respectively; def more hardcore hip-hop than I usually spin, but hey, trying to pick out all of the samples and seeing how they all fit together is a blast.  Once your done '[buy now](http://illegalart.net/webshop/section.php?section=illegalart)' if you're so inclined, fun stuff.
