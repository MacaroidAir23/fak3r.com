### Abstract:

-------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------

Your abstract will be used for the website and printed materials. Summarize what your presentation will cover.



While privacy and security have always been important, in the past few years it's become far more well known about government and corporations overreach in pursuit of power, and/or money.




Alfred Glover @AlfredKGlover
cybersecurity is one of the global challenges nobody can seem to get a handle on. gotta protect yourself



online privacy and security


from fake news spread by online troll farms to...

Edward Snowden revealed Five Eyes ()
to
the "Great Firewall" of China...

we know that goverments are not only interested in spying on their own citizens, but they are actively doing it, and saving that data for uses in the future.

if this terrifies you then we have common interests and we should focus on how we can protect ourselves while sharing this knowledge with others in a 

this talk will give users the tools, concepts, and abilities to protect their privacy and security online

### Detailed Outline:

-------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------


This is the most important section on the application. You must provide a detailed outline containing the main points and navigation through your talk - show how you intend to begin, where you intend to lead the audience and how you plan to get there. Your outline should be in simple text. Please do not submit slides, Docs, or PDF’s as an outline.

If you are submitting a panel, it’s encouraged to list what each panel member will contribute to on the outline, as well as the estimated time budgeted for those bullet points.

The review board likes submissions that include references to prior works and research you used in developing your presentation. The detailed your outline then the better we are able to best review your presentation against other submissions (and the higher chance you have of being accepted).

0) Introduction
* whoami
- work history with open source and privacy, plus general information technology roles
- past presentations covering global data sharing, online privacy, infosec, information security
> all of my other talks are all available online (https://www.slideshare.net/phil.cryer) specifically ones dealing with online privacy and security from years past (https://www.slideshare.net/phil.cryer/0nline-privacy-concerns)
> ideals like “With social media, users’ vanity has trumped previously held mores concerning privacy” me, 2011
- 15 years of being online, and blogging for the most of them, at https://fak3r.com reveals howtos where I developed/evolved my ideas and methods (howtos, exploration, investigation)
- what I do day to day and how I've evolved my methods and approaches to staying secure online
	
1) Expectations
* the WHAT of this talk; specifically what the audience will learn from the presentation, notably
- online concern for security and privacy, addressed by understanding and utilizing tools
- client applications and configurations to greatly increase online privacy
- server applications deployed locally or remotely, the pros and cons of these tools, including (minimal) cost considerations
* a balanced approach to online security and privacy versus convenience; if something is too difficult, users will find workarounds 
> don't do this! Instead find a balance with what you're comfortable with - addressing your own threat profile versus what tools you are comfortable using

2) Concerns
* the WHY of this talk; why should users be concerned about their privacy and security online
- within China: government overreach in surveillance 
- ingress and egress in China: censorship (the great firewall of china*)
- global information sharing: Edward Snowden revelation of the Five Eyes (FVEY)
> "an intelligence alliance comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States."
> another document leaked by Edward Snowden says that there is another working agreement amongst 14 nations officially known as SIGINT Seniors Europe, or "SSEUR". These "14 Eyes" consist of the same members of 9 Eyes plus Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain and Sweden." 
- corporate social media companies putting profit over user's privacy
> global examples: facebook, twitter, youtube, etc, plenty to scope out here
> within China: WEIBO (微博), RENREN (人人) WECHAT (微信) 4. YOUKU TUDOU (优酷土豆) 5. DIANPING (大众点评)
> talk about examples that the audience would be most interested (and threatened) by

3) Getting started
* General concepts
- almost all examples and concepts will work REGARDlESS of operating system (stay agnostic)
> but when taking things into consideration, do the best you can, ala: windows < macOS < Linux < *BSD
* how much will all this cost?
> all of these client-side tools are open source, and/or, free
> all server-side tools are free, but some *may* require local, or remote hardware for enhanced privacy, these introduce some, but low, cost (approximately 5 USD or 31 CNY per month)
> hardware token options for 2FA or OTP usage, to really secure things on the client side (approximately 50 USD / 316 CNY)
> (optional) password server fee, but for advanced features (2FA) there is an annual cost (USD 24 / 152 CNY)

4) Tools
* client-side
- overview of what will be covered in this section; client-side user tools - browsers, browser plugins, password managers, instant messaging, and email
https://privacy.haus/
* browsers
- much like the OS exercise, go for what fits your threat profile, in general chrome < chromium < firefox < SRWare Iron < Tor Browser bundle
- all options are free - but there differences with all of these choices
> chrome - for profit, closed source because they add proprietary tools, and an additional cost (your data)
( plugins - video AAC, H.264, and MP3, Adobe Flash (PPAPI). Chrome includes a sandboxed Pepper API (PPAPI) Flash plug-in that Google automatically updates along with Chrome, google update toos, extention restrictions, crash and error reporting (telementary data), and security sandbox (which can be on in Chromium too!)
> chromium - google's open source option, without the features (bloat?) above
> firefox - open source browser, not from a for profit organization, promises to put the user (and the user's privacy) first
> SRWare Iron - "the future of the browser", more analogus to chromium, "SRWare Iron: The browser of the future - based on the free Sourcecode "Chromium" - without any problems at privacy and security"
> Tor browser bundle - an easy way to use a browser (firefox), and connect to the Tor network, "Tor is free software for enabling anonymous communication. The name is derived from an acronym for the original software project name "The Onion Router" - but lets define what anonymous is in this case, and what you can (and can't) count on it for
* browser-plugins
- to enhance your online security and privacy online it is essential to use browser plugins to change settings, and block tracking where possible
> https everywhere - a plugin from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) that automatically keeps you on the more secure https protocol, when available on the site
> privacy badger - another EFF plugin that promotes, "..a balanced approach to internet privacy between consumers and content providers by blocking advertisements and tracking cookies that do not respect the Do Not Track setting in a user's web browser. While some of its code is based on Adblock Plus, Privacy Badger only blocks those ads which come with embedded trackers."
> uBlock Origin  - a traditional "ad blocker" that blocks ads, tracking, etc from a domain block list that you can control. This blocks far more than Privacy Badger, so understand how it works, what it does and why it can break some sites.
> a password manager plugin (see next section)

* password management
- forget your passwords!
- tools to manage your passwords, help with generation of very complex passwords, allows you to use different passwords on EVERY site you have to login to, and you will never have to know/remember the passwords
> open source options - keypass, what that will get you as far as security and convience
> lastpass, free to use basic service, cross platform (win, mac, linux, android, ios) and recommended, not expensive to become a premium user (USD 24 / 152 CNY), this opens up options like using a 2FA option (yubikey, google auth, etc) 
> 1password - popular macOS option, but no linux client 
- point is, if you're not using a password manager, use one... NOW	
	
* email
- yes, we're still talking about this! 
> traditional email is not secure, and really this is by default
- email that is 'secure' may be secure in your browser (https), or your client (tls), but once it gets securely to the mail server it may/may not be fully encrypted as it passes over the internet - so that's not secure 
- so again, considering your threat profile, how much can you do / or need to do?
- send PGP encrypted messages (not for the faint hearted, but getting easier with newer tools), but requires both users to be pretty into wanting to do crypto (not very practical)
- protonmail - easy to do encrypted email "end to end" in the browser, but both users need to be protonmail users, and send/check from protomail... this works, but again it's leaving out those not in the know 
- zerobin - while not email, an approach more analogus to sending PGP encrypted messages, here a pastebin like service runs 'zerobin', a service that is encrypted in the browser, provides a unique URL to share that can be password protected, with messages that can be auto deleted after so many days, or the popular 'burn after reading' feature where a message goes away once it's read. Passing messages this way is not as secure as PGP b/c you can't control the user side, but with a password restriction and BAR option, you can at least verify after the message is read that it was read by the intended individual

* IM / SMS / text messaging	
* while IM/SMS/text messaging used to be as insecure as email, that's changed in many ways
- IM, but not AIM anymore! sorry. the issues with most IM as they're not federated like email, so if you use one kind of IM you can't talk to the other (well without some work-arounds)
> do you need IM, or can you just do IRC via TLS? A lot of people do (me) - also, change your password one you go encrypted
> Tox - no central server, the system is distributed, peer-to-peer, and end-to-end encrypted. This is a great solution, but requires both users to be running TOX
> chat secure - an XMPP based optoin, can use existing google accounts for auth, or public servers, but also supports OMEMO encryption and OTR encryption over XMPP. 
> Riot - new option, uses the (matrix protocol https://matrix.org/) over XMPP

		keybase
		wire

* SMS / text messaging
- this allows you to use SMS to securely communicate, and currently there's one game in town
> signal - allows E2E (end to end) encryption between you and another signal user, otherwise it functions as a normal (unencrypted) SMS client, still it's good to have it so you can communicate securely over SMS
> they now have an excellent desktop client, but it only works to chat with your other signal contacts, again, insuring security

* big name options, facebook messanger, whats app, telegram, are more secure than old options, the first two actually use the signal protocol, but these options are still owned by big, for profit companies. consider your threat profile when going this route!


* server-side
 		
		tor

		dns (unbound)
	
		pi-hole 
			* A black hole for Internet advertisements
			* run on a raspberry pi
			* https://pi-hole.net/


		streisand (automated vpn setup)
			* Streisand sets up a new server running your choice of L2TP/IPsec, OpenConnect, OpenSSH, OpenVPN, Shadowsocks, sslh, Stunnel, a Tor bridge, and WireGuard.
			* vps - 5$/month digital ocean or similar
			* https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand


5) Conclusion
* using these ideas will make you more secure and private online, and best of all, will help you understand what you're exposing yourself to when you're online. (the real lesson)
- thanks to def con china, the entire community, freaks on twitter that have given me confidence to share things I know about, and ... you
