![Mock turtleneck - fail!](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/27750-2t.jpg)It's time to start up a new feature, an outlet for my critical eye that I call _things I don't like_, or TIDL for short.  To kick things off I'll start with mock turtlenecks. The online [Merriam-Webster dictionary defines them](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mock+turtleneck) this way: _mock turtleneck __Function: __noun _Date: 1966  1 **:** a collar that is lower and usually looser than a turtleneck and is not turned over  2 _**:** a garment with a mock turtleneck_, while a [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo_neck) paints them with the same brush as a _polo neck shirt_.  So they clearly fail as a turtleneck, so what's the point?  They look lame, and I suspect most people who wear them are unaware of this fact, so please, pass it on; mock turtlenecks are on the list of things that I don't like!
