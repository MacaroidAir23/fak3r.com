![Ubuntu Linux](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/ubuntu-logo.png)Ah, so my very first accepted story submission to the venerable [Slashdot.org](http://slashdot.org/) occurred today, and it’s a dozy.  ”_Sun today announced that they are [putting their weight behind Ubuntu Linux](http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/software/soa/Sun_flirts_with_Ubuntu/0,2000061733,39256815,00.htm).  While Ubuntu has been many people’s desktop Linux choice for a few years now, with its Debian heritage, you can see what kind of server it could be.  Slap that on the new Sun 1Us with the new Niagra T1’s CPU, the one that will have four, six or eight cores each, and go to town_.”  Strange that the editors changed the URL I gave with one to ZDNet, but hey.  Also, sharp readers caught on to my misspelling, which was kinda funny really.  I wrote Niagra versus the ‘real’ name of the new Sun CPU: the UltraSparc T1 Niagara.  Opps.  Can you tell I’m currently rebuilding a mail server with all sorts of anti-spam features?
