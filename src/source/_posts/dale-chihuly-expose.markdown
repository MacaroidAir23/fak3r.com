![chihuly.jpg](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/chihuly.jpg)Since first studying his work in art classes during college, I knew that Dale Chihuly produced things differently than the traditional current artists that most people envision. He has a 'factory' where 'helpers' follow his directions in assisting in creating the glass sculptures. This wasn't unprecedented, as masters did this type of stuff 100s of years ago. Fast forward a few years and I was placing his works (very carefully!) in the gallery space where I worked in for years after college. His pieces were beautiful, especially when lit up by the bright display lights, but commanded a bunch of cash. $20,000 is a lot for a nice candy dish, I remember thinking to ![13925-large.jpg](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/13925-large.thumbnail.jpg)myself. Now with a [current exhibit](http://www.mobot.org/chihuly/) here at the [Missouri Botanical Gardens](http://www.mobot.org/), and other recent shows, The Seattle Times is running three days of [investigative reporting](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/news/local/chihuly/) on the artist, whose filing of copyright lawsuits has opened his business practices to scrutiny and criticism. [Day one](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/chihulyinc/2003178395_chihuly06.html) focuses on the overall business, the building and marketing of the Chihuly brand, the company's sales practices and factory production methods. Accompanying![glass-chihuly.jpg](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/glass-chihuly.thumbnail.jpg) material includes an informative slide show on the different methods of creating glass art. [Day two](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/chihulyinc/2003178405_chihuly07.html) hones in on Chihuly's clever deals with charitable organizations who purchase his work for resale. Finally, [day three](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/chihulyinc/2003182065_chihuly08.html) gets to the trigger for all of the inquiry, the lawsuits and speculation on why he decided to take two fellow artists to court. "_The overall message is clear: Chihuly Inc. is a business, a successful one that has taken full opportunity from (some would say advantage of) PBS and philanthropic partnerships. They will protect their assets as a business would and do what it takes to keep the money coming in and their products at high value_."
