While the artist Stanley Donwood might not be a household name, his artwork is immediately recognizable. As the former art-school friend of Thom Yorke, he has been Radiohead’s resident cover artist, having designed all of the band’s record art since 1994’s _My Iron Lung_ EP. Most recently he created the frontispiece of Tom Yorke’s solo debut, The Eraser.

He now has a show at [Iguapop Gallery](http://www.iguapop.net/) in Barcelona, Spain opening this week entitled [_Dead Children Playing_](http://www.slowlydownward.com/deadchildrenplaying.html) highlighting his work with the band, and features the art for Kid A, Amnesiac, and Hail To The Thief, among others. I've always loved his work, although I never knew who created it. I always assumed it was some offshoot alias of Thom Yorke's, so it's nice to see more of the background of the artist.

His website [Slowly Downward](http://www.slowlydownward.com/) highlights more of his art and writings, while being immediately familiar to anyone who has visited Radiohead's website. After the show he posted on his site that, "[Barcelona is a fucking great city](http://www.slowlydownward.com/DCPnews.html)", which I love to hear; it's a city I've long wanted to visit. I really love his artwork, and these three stand on their own beautifully.
