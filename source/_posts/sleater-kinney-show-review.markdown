It's always cool when you find a review of a show you've been to, but add a picture, and then you're really feelin' it.  The venerable Pitchfork has a review of Sleater-Kinney's [October 8th show at Mississippi Nights](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/features/live/s/sleater-kinney-05/), and I would call it spot on.  What a great band, more solid and confident than I've ever seen them, with a packed crowd that just went nuts for everything they did.  That kind of response makes me happy to be seeing shows in St. Louis, and is what a rock and roll show is supposed to be like.  And yeah, I came there to be entertained Carrie, and I was, so don't fret.
