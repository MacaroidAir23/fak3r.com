Over the past few days I've become quite the fan of [Blitzen Trapper](http://blitzentrapper.net/) from Portland, Oregon. A single on _Subpop's_ 20 year anniversary CD (which I got in a goodie bag on [Record Store Day](http://www.fak3r.com/2008/04/28/first-ever-record-store-day-rocked/)BTW) led me to this track, which turns out to be NOT indicative of their style. I'm giving their recent release a run now, and it reminds me at times of another Portland band, Menonema which is good. This track is more acoustic, but I love the Elliot Smith sounding vocals and the dreamy, story like lyrics - it's a winner.
