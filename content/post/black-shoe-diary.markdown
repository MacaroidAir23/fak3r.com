![tmnt](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/tmnt.jpg)I haven't read McSweeney's in a long time, and only passively checked it out years ago after being hipped to it by the recommended links in my friend Yvonne's blog.  Today I stumbled back upon it, and read what has got to be one of the funniest things I've read online in a long time.  From writer Eric Feezell, [Black Shoe Diary: The Daily Musings of Shuruku Umezawa: Junior Salesman, Ninja](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/2006/7/24feezell.html).  I haven't had this kind of 'try not to laugh out loud because people around the office will think you're crazy' feeling in a long time, and I  love it.  Once read, be sure to checkout [Installment Two](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/2007/1/24feezell.html) and [Installment Three](http://mcsweeneys.net/2007/6/27feezell.html).  These articles give me hope for the future of mankind.
