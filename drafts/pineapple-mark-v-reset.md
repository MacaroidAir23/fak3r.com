I have an old(er) [Pineapple Mark V](https://www.wifipineapple.com/) AP (accesspoint), which is useful for wireless recon, and exploration. While the hardware is decent, the provided software is excellent and makes it easy to do all sorts of cool stuff with the device. As it's time for [DEF CON](https://defcon.com) again this year, I got out the venerable Pineapple to get it ready to bring along, but I wanted to update it. Hitting the Pineapple site only gave me info on the
new hotness; the new models they're hawking this year, which is fine, but I want to reset/update this older unit. After digging in the forums I figured out what I needed to do.

I'm trying to perform a factory reset with my Mark V, but it won't work.

I ve done the following:

Turn device off.
Set switches
Switch 1 - UP
Switch 2 - DOWN
Switch 3 - DOWN
Switch 4 - UP
Switch 5 - UP
Turn device on
Wait 5 minutes
Turn device off
Now when I turn on the device the LEDS give me the following:

Green: Constant
Yellow: blinks
Blue: blinks
Red: blinks
What to do?


NOTE: With the switches facing you, they are ordered 1 - 5 from left to right.
