![FreeBSD](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/freebsd_new_icon.jpg)Well, to make a long story short, we're back.  Installed a fresh version of FreeBSD 6.1 on my old(er) server that I built a few years back, and it's humming along nicely.  Going to try and make things simpler here, add a little more focus and less razzle dazzle - which seems to be something like feature creep here in the blog world.  For now, sit back, I'll have some new music coming up, geek talk and later maybe some beer.  You can keep up by subscribing to the feed.  I'll update it to point to feedburner and put up the sub by email option again soon to get this show back on the road.
