Ah, being on call will do it to you, and this spoof of the classic [_Glengarry Glen Ross_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104348/) monologue sums things up perfectly today.  At least it's Friday, and it reminds me that I need to watch that movie again too. (warning, plenty of language, and it's all bad).
