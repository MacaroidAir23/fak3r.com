![Edward Jones](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/n1_ej_logo.gif)It's rewarding when you work at a company that seems universally recognized as a great place to work.  I've only found this out recently, since my current employer, Edward Jones, always makes the 'best of' lists.  Today it was ranked on Computerworld's list of 100 Best Places to Work in IT at [number 52](http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9024364).   Meanwhile Jones has been on Fortune's 100 Best Companies To Work For for years, and they're [currently ranked at 29](http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/bestcompanies/2007/full_list/index.html).  That's awesome, it really says something about the company if internal and external forces are agreeing on things.  I'm happy since I get too play in Linux while avoiding the stress of support.  /me ahhh...
