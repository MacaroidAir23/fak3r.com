![Dell-linux](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/dell-linux_penguin1.jpg)I've read a few posts online that review Dell's Linux support, and most complain that they have to call the 'regular' number first, only to get the "What version of Windows are you running?" support.  After redirected to the correct number for Linux support, they get excellent support.  So, to try and help propogate the Linux support numbers, I present them here.  Dell's Linux support number for hardware is 866-622-1947, and for software it's 866-982-8688.  Additionally, the online [Linux Community Support forum](http://www.dellcommunity.com/supportforums/board?board.id=sw_linux) will likely solve most problems for you even before you're done dialing.
