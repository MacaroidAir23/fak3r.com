![Defcon logo](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/defconlogo.gif)Oh yeah, I'm going to [Defcon](http://defcon.org/) again this year, just found out this Friday for sure.  It's August 3rd - 5th, in Las Vegas, and this year it's all paid for by my new consulting group; what a great thing.  I argued that I would learn so much more there than any class, for a fraction of the cost; and I will.  More on this later.
