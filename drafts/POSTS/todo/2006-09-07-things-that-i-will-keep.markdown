I could write a website about [Guided by Voices](http://gbv.com/) (GbV) and how much they mean to me, but who has the time?  Instead here's a song from their later years; years fraught with releases that were far more produced, and thus not nearly as good as their mid period peak (1994, I'm looking at you) - yet this one stands out, and it was a great one live. Bob, a salty salute to you, always!  Things that I will keep indeed.
