![gethuman.png](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/gethuman.png)From the great Freakonomics.com, an article about [an online database that'll get you through the 'phone trees'](http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/2006/09/03/things-to-do-in-customer-service-hell/) or mazes anytime you have to call some company for customer service. _"One solution to Phone Tree Hell is the beautifully named [GetHuman database](http://gethuman.com/us/), which provides a nearly encyclopedic list of companies’ phone numbers and the string of menu choices you must press to bypass the phone tree and get to a human. Example: “SUNOCO … 800‑278‑6626 … Press 0 five times, then mumble when prompted for an account number.”  _I've always hit 00000000000, but perhaps some have caught on to that.  This is a nice service, I'll give it a go next time I need to call up one of these places.  And why do all of them spout on about, "Please Listen Closely, As Our Menu Options Have Changed", sorry, but I'm not buying that.
