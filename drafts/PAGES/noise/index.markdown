Here are **my favorite music releases from the past years**; these are songs I need to be able to continue functioning at my present outstanding level. Also, after [going through though the shelves](http://fak3r.com/2006/12/08/i-heart-music/) for many years, I have built a list of my [**favorite albums of all time**](http://fak3r.com/favorite-noise-of-all-time/), which I'm constantly updating.
