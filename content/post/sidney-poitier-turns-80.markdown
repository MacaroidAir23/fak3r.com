![Guess Who’s Comming to Dinner](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/sidney_poitier_guess_whos_coming_to_dinn_1b.jpg)One of my favorite actors, Sidney Poitier, turns 80 today.  While displaying his talent as a powerful actor, his films have often dealt with race and civil rights in America.  He won the Best Actor Oscar for  his role in 1963's [Lilies of the Field](http://imdb.com/title/tt0057251/), and went on to star and direct [many more](http://imdb.com/name/nm0001627/) (hey, he even directed Stir Crazy!), but it was his two films from 1967, [Guess Who's Coming to Dinner](http://imdb.com/title/tt0061735/) and [In the Heat of the Night](http://imdb.com/title/tt0061811/), that are my favorites.  Very recommended.  Also, his autobiography “The Measure of a Man" was picked by Oprah Winfrey to join her "book club" just last month.  "_Poitier’s book combines memories of such plays and films as “A Raisin in the Sun” and “The Defiant Ones” with observations about the Academy Award-winning actor’s childhood, his religious faith, his thoughts on racism and the influence of such world leaders as Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi. “He writes really candidly and passionately about his childhood, his family, relationships and his extraordinary career,” Winfrey said on her show, which airs from Chicago. “It really is about what makes character, what makes you be who you are. He is the measure of one of the greatest men I think who has ever been on our planet._”
