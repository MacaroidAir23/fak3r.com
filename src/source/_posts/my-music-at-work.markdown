![Sonny Rollins](http://cryer.us/fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/sonny.jpg)Marketing, it’s pretty pervasive, and with the ‘we noticed you bought this, so we thought you’d be interested in buying this’ routine it’s very personalized now.  So today I’m working on a ton of source file conversions; moving files from here to there, running a Perl script over and over, cutting/pasting converted files out…and repeat.  It’s a task waiting for a ‘while true do’ loop, but it won’t work like that.  Anyway, so it’s a perfect day for me to get into some mid-late bebop era Jazz that I can’t get enough of, so I’m listening to Sonny Rollins’ 1966 [The Bridge](http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,156128,00.html); a more mellow (well at least mid-tempo) Rollins release featuring a sweet little quartet working it out.  I see a new email on my home account, so I check it out, from the subject I see it’s an automated Amazon.com email trying to get me to buy something, but when I open it, it’s an offer to pre-order a new Sonny Rollins CD, [Milestone Profile](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F8DT3M/ref=pe_snp_T3M/102-9053770-0617736?n=5174).  It appears to be a double CD of material he’s released via the Milestone label from 1966-2006.  Anyway, just thought that was pretty cool.  Now playing, Sonny Rollins [Plus 4](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006SFBH/qid=1148573178/sr=2-2/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_2/102-9053770-0617736?s=music&v=glance&n=5174) (but not the SACD version that is pictured…hmmm)
