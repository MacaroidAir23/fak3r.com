![Wii](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/wii.jpg)Yea! I got a [Wii](http://wii.com/) for my 38th birthday this weekend, and it is very sweet.  Believe all of the hype, it's a blast for all to play.  So far tennis, boxing and bowling are rockin' m(ii)e.  Plus, after my first round of boxing I had to take a break; it's a real workout, with sweat included.  Time to try the wii sports diet for myself.  So far both kids and wife are lovin' the wii just as much.  In the words of Ferris Bueller, “_It’s so choice. If you have the means, I highly recommend it._”  Also, notice the new wii topic; oh yeah.  More soon...
