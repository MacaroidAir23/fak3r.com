![Donkey Kong in post-it notes](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/dk_postit.jpg)Ten engineering students at UCSC [recreated Donkey Kong using ~6400 3x3" Post-ItÂ® Notes](http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/~inio/dk/) on glass covering 4 floors x 2 windows E2 Building UCSC.  In the 'About this piece' section they note, "_Donkey Kong (Miyamoto, et. al.,1981) was the first appearance of the Itallian plumber we now know as Mario. While this game's early '80s arcade popularity predates most of today's engineering students, it represents the amazing results that a small development team can produce. Today Donkey Kong is ranked as the 3rd most popular arcade game of all time, selling over 65,000 units._"
