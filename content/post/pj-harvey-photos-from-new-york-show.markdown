![PJNY](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/pjny.jpg)Some amazing photos of PJ Harvey at her [New York show last night](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/46297-photos-pj-harvey-new-york-ny-101007) at the Beacon Theatre.  Especially cool since she's playing two (2!) stops on this 'tour' of America.  I first saw her in 1993 and have always been amazed at the way she's evolved as an artist.  I *highly* recommend you pickup _Is This Desire_, and if you're a fan of that and want more guitars grab _Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea_.  I actually have a DVD download that I need to burn at home on the computer, a great but short (festival date) show from a few years back.  For now here's hoping she plots out another tour, with more than two dates!
