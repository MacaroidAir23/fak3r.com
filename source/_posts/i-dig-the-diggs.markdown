Been hipped to the band [The Diggs](http://www.thediggs.com/) of late, after extensive mp3 blog surfing led me to get to know them (being bored at work has it's benefits).   It's what I've been looking for lately, and I highly recommend them.  Haven't found anything like this recently, you know, the newer/indie/shoegazey (mbv ) stuff with the blend of Broken Social Scene-age, and from a trio to boot. The live pic below is from their Northsix show, from just a scant few days ago in Brooklyn.  Listen to two tracks from their second effort, named [Commute,](http://cdbaby.com/cd/thediggs2) below.
