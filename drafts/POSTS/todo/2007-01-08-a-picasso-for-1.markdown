_![Picasso](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/5881926_bg2.jpg)_Whenever I see yard sales I see a lot of old kids toys and clothes, next time I'll look closer, perhaps there's [a Picasso in the lot for cheap](http://www.wect.com/Global/story.asp?s=5881926). "_Pete Bivens and his fiancé had the painting analyzed last week by art historians. They think the painting could be an original piece. Now they have to begin the lengthy process of having the painting carbon dated and authenticated. Bivens and his fiancé bought the painting at a yard sale more than a decade ago for one dollar. Experts think a Carolina Beach couple owns a real Pablo Picasso masterpiece."_
