![Amy Winehouse](http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/awinehouse_070816_rosiegreenway_74479160.jpg)**UPDATE: **So Amy took 4 of the 5 awards she was nominated for, Mark Ronson, the producer of _Back To Black_ took Producer of the years, and most importantly [she tore it up on a medley of _I'm no Good_ and _Rehab _from London](http://www.celebratty.net/amy-winehouse-dedicates-grammys-win-to-my-incarcerated-after-scooping-five-awards).  Good for her.

While I can't think of a time I looked forward to the Grammys, this year is the exception.  After getting approval from the rehab center she's currently staying in, she was still denied a visa to travel to the US to attend the Grammys, but [Amy Winehouse will perform via satellite for the show](http://www.celebratty.net/update-amy-winehouse-to-perform-at-grammys-via-satellite).  She has the most nominations shy of Kanye West, and with good reason, her cd _Back To Black_ is a stunner.  Between her strong, soulful voice, her songwriting and arrangements, this is amazing music that I can heartily recommend to everyone.  It's great to hear she's doing better, and I look forward to seeing her belt it out as only she can.  "_I’m raring to go and really excited to be performing at my first Grammy Awards,” says Amy, “I’d like to thank everyone for their support over the last couple of weeks. I’m really sorry I can’t be there but I appreciate that I'm being given a second chance via satellite” Winehouse said in a statement to Access Hollywood. _ [...] _She is nominated for six Grammys, including Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Pop Female Performance for “Rehab,” Album of the Year, Best New Artist, and Best Pop Vocal Album for “Back to Black"._
