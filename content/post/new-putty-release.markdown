![PuTTY](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/putty-icon.gif)The first new version of [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) in over two years has been released.  For anyone that has had to connect to Unix servers via telnet or SSH from Windows hosts, you know how important PuTTY is. (Windows `cmd` commandline has always been a joke) Providing an `xterm` terminal emulator to work in, the familiar putty.exe has followed me everywhere (it's even on my USB keychain).  Version 0.59 comes with a [host of changes](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/changes.html) including speed, plenty of SSH-2 improvements and plenty of bugfixes.
