How media impacts local environmental debates:

Here's my cousin, Jon Bowermaster speaking at TEDxAlbany 2013 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seeMboLrN5s

He's been doing 'adventuring' and writing for National Geographic for about 25 years, been to Antarctica a bunch of times, traveled the world making films about the environment. A few years ago he got involved in the anti-fracking movement, especially in New York state. So this talk shares interesting comments on how films can help effect change. Good stuff.
