![Velvet Underground](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/velvet-underground.jpg)It's back on, [after the failed effort](http://fak3r.com/2006/12/04/ultra-rare-velvet-underground-vinyl-on-ebay-for-over-100k/), the  rare Velvet Underground acetate is back on eBay.   "_We ran [this auction](http://cgi.ebay.com/VELVET-UNDERGROUND-NICO-1966-Acetate-LP-ANDY-WARHOL_W0QQitemZ300060897304QQihZ020QQcategoryZ306QQssPageNameZWDVWQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem)_ last week, but as we have reported to the international press which has enquirer, the winning bid was found to have been perpetrated by prankster.  We are rerunning the auction this time with amendments to the effect that in the present auction, identities of bidders will be kept private to avoid attracting non-serious attention-seeking bidders, and we are also requiring that interested bidders register before bidding so that we may examine their references.  We are hopeful that this will ensure a fair and accurate auction result which will reflect actual market interest.  - Scott Wax, Saturn Records"  Should be interesting to see how much this really goes for.
