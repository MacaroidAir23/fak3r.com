These are good ones, and I already have some in place; to do list, eating healthy, exercise (yoga, though I need to do it far more than once a week), take a break, etc.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Start by saying no.</strong> Everyone is making demands upon you during this festive time of year, but you do not have to agree to everything. Your coworkers are begging you for favors, but you have a deadline on a project. Saying no every once in a while to give yourself some room to breathe is definitely the first step to keeping your sanity.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Simplify your day.</strong> The easiest way to make sure everything is getting done is to make a “To Do” list. Add new items as demands are placed on you and prioritize. When you finish a task, mark it off the list. You will be surprised at how much easier it is to keep track of your work by doing something so simple.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Clean your workspace. </strong>Clutter can make anyone stressed out and uncomfortable. Take time each morning or afternoon to tidy your desk or office space. This can eliminate distraction and clear your mind to concentrate on the tasks at hand.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Change your surroundings. </strong>Decorate your office with all the items that make you happy. Spread the holiday cheer and put up colorful decorations that make you smile. Make sure that you do not shove your religion into the faces of others when doing this. Find neutral holiday decorations if deciding to go this route.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Light your office properly.</strong> Bad lighting can cause unnecessary eyestrain and increase fatigue. Fluorescent lighting can also be tiring. If you do not have the luxury of having your own office with a window, try turning off the overhead light and bringing in a lamp from home.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Surround yourself with happy people.</strong> Distance yourself from negative office gossip and people that drain you of energy. Create a positive network of people in the office that smile and lift your spirits.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Sit back and relax.</strong> Set aside a few minutes in your day to sit back and just breathe. Take a few minutes after lunch or a couple in the morning to meditate or delve into some office yoga.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Take a break. </strong>Sometimes you just need to step away from your work for a moment to free your mind. Make a point to get out of the office every day if even just for a short walk outside or to go out to lunch. You can also be productive without being in the office – try scheduling different locations for meetings, or attend a seminar or community event.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Eat healthy.</strong> It is so easy to grab a snack from the vending machine or hit up a fast food restaurant at lunch just to save time. Instead, try packing a healthier lunch the night before. You do not have to go on a diet to eat healthy. Just cut back on foods that can leave you feeling drained, such as sugars and carbohydrates. You may want to also pick up a multivitamin. Drink plenty of water – it is recommended that you drink half of your weight in fluid ounces a day. Eat plenty of healthy snacks – this speeds up the metabolism and keeps you from overindulging at lunch.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Exercise. </strong>Quit making excuses and set aside some time for exercise. If you do not currently have an exercise routine, now is the time to think about one. Start by asking friends what they do for exercise or maybe even a personal trainer at a gym. When all else fails, use the most valuable source available to you – the Internet. Think of it this way – your new exercise routine will work really well with that New Year’s resolution that we all promise ourselves every year.</li>\n</ol>\n","source":"_posts/10-steps-to-becoming-stress-free.markdown","raw":"---\nauthor: phil\ncomments: true\ndate: 2007-01-22 12:51:07\nlayout: post\nslug: 10-steps-to-becoming-stress-free\ntitle: 10 steps to becoming stress free\nwordpress_id: 362\ncategories:\n- General\ntags:\n- health\n---\n\n![stress](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/stress.gif)I found [this article](http://community.emeraldcoast.com/article.showarticle.db.php?a=6414) about _10 Steps to Becoming Stress Free_ before the holidays, but I saved it to post for later, at a time when we're through with thinking about that time of year, and have a chance to really integrate it (or at least plan on integrating it) into our lives.

Your coworkers are begging you for favors, but you have a deadline on a project. Saying no every once in a while to give yourself some room to breathe is definitely the first step to keeping your sanity.\n\n\t\n  2. **Simplify your day.** The easiest way to make sure everything is getting done is to make a “To Do” list. Add new items as demands are placed on you and prioritize. When you finish a task, mark it off the list. You will be surprised at how much easier it is to keep track of your work by doing something so simple.\n\n\t\n  3. **Clean your workspace. **Clutter can make anyone stressed out and uncomfortable. Take time each morning or afternoon to tidy your desk or office space. This can eliminate distraction and clear your mind to concentrate on the tasks at hand.\n\n\t\n  4. **Change your surroundings. **Decorate your office with all the items that make you happy. Spread the holiday cheer and put up colorful decorations that make you smile. Make sure that you do not shove your religion into the faces of others when doing this. Find neutral holiday decorations if deciding to go this route.\n\n\t\n  5. **Light your office properly.** Bad lighting can cause unnecessary eyestrain and increase fatigue. Fluorescent lighting can also be tiring. If you do not have the luxury of having your own office with a window, try turning off the overhead light and bringing in a lamp from home.\n\n\t\n  6. **Surround yourself with happy people.** Distance yourself from negative office gossip and people that drain you of energy. Create a positive network of people in the office that smile and lift your spirits.\n\n\t\n  7. **Sit back and relax.** Set aside a few minutes in your day to sit back and just breathe. Take a few minutes after lunch or a couple in the morning to meditate or delve into some office yoga.\n\n\t\n  8. **Take a break. **Sometimes you just need to step away from your work for a moment to free your mind. Make a point to get out of the office every day if even just for a short walk outside or to go out to lunch. You can also be productive without being in the office – try scheduling different locations for meetings, or attend a seminar or community event.\n\n\t\n  9. **Eat healthy.** It is so easy to grab a snack from the vending machine or hit up a fast food restaurant at lunch just to save time. Instead, try packing a healthier lunch the night before. You do not have to go on a diet to eat healthy. Just cut back on foods that can leave you feeling drained, such as sugars and carbohydrates. You may want to also pick up a multivitamin. Drink plenty of water – it is recommended that you drink half of your weight in fluid ounces a day. Eat plenty of healthy snacks – this speeds up the metabolism and keeps you from overindulging at lunch.\n\n\t\n  10. **Exercise. **Quit making excuses and set aside some time for exercise. If you do not currently have an exercise routine, now is the time to think about one. Start by asking friends what they do for exercise or maybe even a personal trainer at a gym. When all else fails, use the most valuable source available to you – the Internet. Think of it this way – your new exercise routine will work really well with that New Year’s resolution that we all promise ourselves every year.\n\n\n","updated":1414378977000,"excerpt":"<p><img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/stress.gif\" alt=\"stress\">I found <a href=\"http://community.emeraldcoast.com/article.showarticle.db.php?a=6414\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">this article</a> about <em>10 Steps to Becoming Stress Free</em> before the holidays, but I saved it to post for later, at a time when we’re through with thinking about that time of year, and have a chance to really integrate it (or at least plan on integrating it) into our lives.

It seems to promote 10 positive steps to loose weight that are sensible and attainable.  Perhaps I’ll give this a go sometime soon, even though I only want to loose 15-20 pounds (hello?  Wii Fit?)</p>\n<p>“<em>The following are 10 unconventional weight loss tips that worked for me. Between January 4, 2006 and March 31, 2006 I lost fifty pounds. These tips work well because almost every tip is focused around completing a small goal. In my opinion, to stay motivated and lose a significant amount of weight, you should complete many goals in a short period of time. The reason I call these tips unconventional is that I had not seen a majority of them before starting my diet.</em></p>\n<p><em>I will start by recognizing the typical “calories in, calories out” schpeil. Yes, to lose weight you have to eat well and exercise. But there is much more to it than that, and I don’t want to spend time regurgitating ideas you’ve heard before. That brings me to the first point:</em></p>\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n\n<p><strong><strong>Buy a digital scale</strong>_<br>This seems easy enough. I recommend that before starting a diet, buy a scale that is accurate to .2 (two-hundredths of a pound). I will explain why below. I also recommend either buying a scale that can record your daily weight, or manually logging your weight everyday. I bought a</strong> scale that was accurate to .2 and logged my weight at Sam’s Club for $22. It has been a great investment._</p>\n<p><em>_<strong>Weigh yourself everyday</strong></em><br>You’ll find that almost every other dieter will tell you to weigh yourself only once a week. I recommend the exact opposite. I am very goal oriented and I like to see results everyday. The reason I recommend buying a scale that is accurate to the .2 is that there is a very big difference between weighting 170.8 one day and 170.0 the next day. Losing .8 pounds in one day is excellent. However, if your scale is not accurate enough to report the loss and still shows 170 after a day of healthy eating and working out, you will feel extremely discouraged. A more detailed scale makes it easier to keep a positive outlook. The more successes (days with positive weight loss) the easier it is._</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Drink 8 glasses of water everyday</strong>_<br>This one is obvious and broadly recommended, however, the reason I recommend it is slightly different. Drinking eight glasses of water per day helps you “feel less hungry.” I can’t prove this scientifically, however, when I am at work, I drink 4 cups in the morning and 4 c</strong>ups in the evening. On the days that I don’t drink the water, I feel hungrier, earlier. Also, on the days I don’t drink water I feel sleepier, sooner. Don’t feel intimidated by trying to drink 8 glasses of water. Try doing what I do: I have a pint glass I keep at work, it holds sixteen ounces (as all pint glasses do). All I do is drink two pints of water in the morning and two in the afternoon._</p>\n<p><em>_<strong>Make your diet public</strong></em><br>Tell people you’re on a diet. There’s no reason to be ashamed to be on a diet. I found that trying to keep my diet a secret was harder than just telling people. In fact, telling your coworkers, girlfriend, family, etc. will increase your accountability. It motivated me knowing that my coworkers and family knew that I was dieting because I did not want to fail. I also chose a typical “fat picture” and put it on my fridge, in my cubicle, and on my wall. I wanted to have a continual reminder to lose the weight. I know it’s a cliche, but it was important for me to remind myself of my ultimate goal._</p>\n<p><em>I feel I should also note that although I was 50 pounds over weight, when I t__old people I was on a diet they often said “you don’t need to diet.” I found this surprising because I was obviously overweight. Beware that you will likely hear similar comments. I found it easier to just accept the “compliment” than to try to justify my diet to them. Remember that you are on a diet for you, and that you do not need to justify yourself.</em></p>\n<p><em>_<strong>Don’t diet on the weekends</strong></em><br>This is another unconventional bit of advice. I was able to lose 50 pounds without dieting on the weekends. I found myself tired, depressed, and unmotivated if I tried to continue my diet into the weekend. I felt that Friday and Saturday (my weekend) was a time to celebrate 5 days of dieting. You may not find this necessary, especially in the first few weeks of a diet. However, as many weeks passed, the weekend became a time for me to celebrate my weekly successes and get myself mentally prepared for another five days of dieting. I considered it a mental recharge._</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Don’t sacrifice your life for your diet</strong>_<br>On occasion, you will find yourself unable to eat healthy. Whether this is becaus</strong>e of lunches with your team at work, birthdays, or special occasions, there will be events that you just can’t (or don’t want to) eat healthy. A diet will feel overwhelming if you have to sacrifice special events in your life. The way I combated this was to exchange a day that I was not going to diet on the weekend. In other words, if I didn’t diet on Tuesday, for example, I would diet on Saturday, instead._</p>\n<p><em>_<strong>Make the small changes</strong></em><br>This is a pretty common tip, however, I have a twist to it. Rather than giving up what most diets say you should give up (soda, coffee, beer, caffeine, etc.) just make healthier decisions. I didn’t want to give anything up, so I decided to make some changes instead. The first switch I made was switching to diet soda. Don’t worry, you’ll quickly get used to the flavor. Before I started my diet, I swore I would never drink diet soda. Now thanks to my girlfriend, diet is the only soda I drink. The second switch I made was to drinking black coffee. Cut out the sugar and creme, and you get the benefits of coffee (caffeine) without the calories. The last major switch I made was to “healthy” beer. I’m a Miller Lite drinker, however, by temporarily switching to Beck’s Premier Light (60 calories per serving) I was able to still enjoy a healthy social life while maintaining my diet.<br><em><br>_In addition to making the small changes in your diet, make the small changes in your life: park further away, walk to the end of the train platform and get in the last car, and vow not to take an elevator for an entire week. I also found it advantageous to wear a pedometer and try to compete against myself for how far I could walk in a single day. The furthest I walked in a day was 6.5 miles. I voluntarily walked to work twice a week.</em></p>\n<p><em>_<strong>Gain perspective by understanding the fractions</strong></em><br>Your diet is an incredibly small fraction of your life. If you live for 80 years, and dieted for four months, that would only be .42% of your life. That’s right, if you diet for four months, it will be less than one half of one percent of your life. On the other hand think of the major benefits you can get from .42% of your life. If it helps you stay motivated, count down the days starting at 120._</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Rationalize your workouts</strong>_<br>Finding the time to get to the gym can be very difficult. However a 1/2 hour wo</strong>rkout is only 2% of your day (assuming 24 hour days). For me, the most motivating thought was comparing my workouts to sitcoms. As a huge Everybody Loves Raymond fan, every time I would sit down to watch an episode, I would remind myself that in the 1/2 hour that I was sitting and doing nothing, I could complete my daily workout._</p>\n<p><em>You’ve lost the weight, what now?</em></p>\n<p><strong><strong>Have a red flag weight</strong>_<br>Once you’ve lost the weight, you need to keep it off. This is where the red flag comes in. You need to pick a weight and vow to never get heavier than it again. It is normal for your body to fluctuate five to ten pounds. I recommend picking a weight that is ten pounds heavier than what you “normally” weigh and never weigh more than it again.  Setting a red flag weight allowed me to keep off every pound for over 1 year</strong>._”</p>\n","source":"_posts/10-unconventional-diet-tips-lose-50-pounds-in-3-months.markdown","raw":"---\nauthor: phil\ncomments: true\ndate: 2008-07-08 11:18:01\nlayout: post\nslug: 10-unconventional-diet-tips-lose-50-pounds-in-3-months\ntitle: '10 Unconventional Diet Tips: lose 50 pounds in 3 months'\nwordpress_id: 379\ncategories:\n- blah\ntags:\n- calories\n- diet\n- dieter\n- health\n- healthy eating\n- loose weight\n- weight loss tips\n---\n\n[![Weigh loss](http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/scale.jpg)](http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/scale.jpg)I found this inspirational post on [Lifehack](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/10-unconventional-diet-tips-how-to-lose-50-pounds-in-three-months.html) once about losing 50 pounds in 3 months, and I've had it bookmarked ever since.  It seems to promote 10 positive steps to loose weight that are sensible and attainable.  Perhaps I'll give this a go sometime soon, even though I only want to loose 15-20 pounds (hello?  Wii Fit?)\n\n\"_The following are 10 unconventional weight loss tips that worked for me.

While this may/may not solely be Apple driven, the fact is that people like choices, and the Macs are now far more compatible with other systems than they once were, so finally folks have options.  In my recent travels to Woods Hole we had ~14-15 developers from around the world, and there were 4 Macs there.  Of course we had the normal thing where someone couldn’t get something working in Windows, Mac folks would chime in with, “just works on a mac” and later when Mac folks couldn’t plug a projector into the certain Macs, the windows folks throw the, “just works in windows”, so it was all in good fun.  So while I don’t consider these folks “enterprise” as in working for a corporation, it clearly shows that more people can use what they want, and have IT adapt for their needs.  I talked to a friend up there about his MacBook Pro - it’s a beauty of a machine, and he loves it b/c he can do everything he needs, plus run windows for dev work that you can only do in Windows.  Of course if I had such a beast it’d be running Linux, and that’s my argument for my buying my Dell laptop; while the Apple is nicer, it was also ~2500$ more than the Dell.  Yes, maybe when my work buys me a ‘top I’ll rethink it - but now I’m thinking smaller again - and I really like the Xseries Thinkpads (used be by IBM, but now it’s Lenovo - but the same otherwise) and they’ve always had excellent Linux ability.  two devs in WH had those, and I had to borrow them - not to work on them, just to pick them up - nice and light, thin, but with high screen resolution.  of course for a full fledged system like thatI could also look at the MacBook which shares most of the Thinkpads features - but for a Mac I’d prefer the black MacBook after my long, drawn out suffering with my old iBook…but I digress.  Now, what was the question?  Oh yeah, more Macs in the workplace, yeah, it’s how I’ve always said it should be, and it’s more that way now.  I run Debian Linux at work now, on my work provided HP desktop machine, on my personal Dell laptop when I bring it, on my Development server, and (soon) on my production server.  What kind of support do I need from IT?  Gimme an IP and a gateway IP and I’m all set.  So, in conclusion, I believe four reasons for Apple’s success with people using more Macs at work is due to the following reasons: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>x86 processor which allows the bridge to those who still <em>think</em> they need Windows.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Microsoft’s epic fail with Vista has frustrated users to no end, witness the stay of execution XP has recieved from Dell.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Apple’s awesome design sense, which cannot be duplicated, puts it in that “wow, gotta have that gadget” bucket</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>and lastly (and maybe to a lighter extent) the fact that Darwin is a Unix derivative, so <em>geeks</em> can use it and get the same thrill they do via Linux.

I’ve  run Linux on the desktop since ~1997, and I’m very comfortable with it…at home.  While there are a few exceptions where companies would let me run Linux on the desktop, that’s not the theme of the larger companies I’ve frequented of late, so of course I’ve had  to use XP for the past 3 years, and it hasn’t been all blood and roses.  First of all I can’t stand the  Fisher-Price UI - it’s awful, really, how dumb do I look? (that’s a rhetorical question)  The first thing I do  to a new system I have to use is to revert the UI back to its ‘classic’ looks - at least this way I wouldn’t be  reminded of how much better XP was supposed to be since they changed the way some widgets look (seriously,  right click on yr desktop, choose ‘Properties’ then look at that same dialog box that you saw in Windows 95!).  I usually end up  making Windows look and act as much like a Linux desktop, to make it more tolerable for me to use, but first we’ll start with what really bugs us about Windows, resources that seem to be constantly straining, regardless  installed RAM!  Disclaimer: use my suggestions as just that, if things catch on fire, businesses fail, war breaks out, I can’t be held responsible.  Having said that, life is short, and what’s the worst that can happen?<a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>I. RESOURCES</strong></p>\n<p>With each iteration of Windows needing more and more memory is required (which contrasts nicely with Linux),  so it is essential to make sure nothing is running on your system that you don’t need.  Unfortunately Microsoft  and other 3rd party providers (RealPlayer, Apple I’m looking at you) love to have things run on your rig at  bootup to ensure they leech your system resources fulltime.  Let’s rip those stole ways outta there!</p>\n<p><ul><br>    <li>Stop things from starting - one of the most infuriating things about having to run Windows is when an  installer puts a shortcut in your startup folder. This eats up your system resources and is usually only there so  the app will ‘launch faster’ when you need it.  Well duh, it’s already running, so sure it’s going to pop up  quickly!  Go to ‘Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Startup’ and delete all of those entries (anything with the words quick  or fast are likely resource hogs, kill em all)</li><br></ul></p>\n<p><ul><br>    <li><img src=\"http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/system-tray-thumb1.jpg\" alt=\"Full system tray\" align=\"right\">Kill all icons in the system tray - I love it when you get a glance at a co-worker’s desktop to see that they have 20 icons in their system tray down by the clock, each one of them a placeholder for some  usually useless application that is leeching system resources while providing no benefit.  These are  usually the result of those ‘startup’ items we killed on the previous step, but there are plenty of other ways  for them to be started up.  First we try and reason with them, right click on each icon and try to figure out how to ‘opt-out’ of those lame things starting up.   If you fail to figure all of them out, don’t worry some are a bit more deceptive than others, we’ll fix them later.</li><br></ul></p>\n<p><ul><br>    <li>Kill the services - now we’ll look at the big services starting up on boot as part of Windows.  Go to ‘Start  -&gt; Settings -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Services’  What needs to be running?  Turn off what you  don’t need, investigate the ones you aren’t sure about.  another option for this is the more consumer friendly msconfig - activate it with Start -&gt; Run ‘msconfig’.  Look at the last tab, ‘Startup’ for a simplified version of Services.</li><br></ul></p>\n<p><ul><br>    <li>Lastly - HACK the registry, maliciously! - last step in reclaiming system resources is to hack the registry to stop  things from running on boot; if you haven’t stopped them yet, this is the last ditch effort to shake them.  To  get into regedit you just need to go to ‘Start -&gt; Run’ and then type ‘regedit’. Nervous types will want to make  a backup of the current registry in case of some disaster, to do this just click on ‘File -&gt; Export’ and save  the .reg file for backup.  Once in regedit we need to expand the tree to get to the startup section, so click  on ‘My Computer -&gt; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -&gt; SOFTWARE -&gt; Microsoft -&gt; Windows -&gt; CurrentVersion -&gt; Run’  Whew, ok,  take a look at the list, it should be obvious what you need to keep.  Anything that isn’t anti-virus or related  to logging into the network is usually junk, but take care not to take out anything that you don’t know what  it does before some Googling.  I’ve become quite bullish on ripping stuff out, but that comes with years of  having to deal with this junk.</li><br></ul><br><strong>II. APPLICATIONS</strong></p>\n<p>There are a number of applications I use and recommend others use to help make Windows work better (or just act  more like Linux), and they’re all free.  Generally I’ll create a ‘bin’ directory within My Documents to install  my new apps to, just so I can keep a tighter leash on them.</p>\n<p><ul><br>    <li> Firefox (<a href=\"http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable</a>) - this is a no brainier, use Firefox, it’s better.  For use in an office environment I recommend using the Firefox available from Portable Apps, as I’ve linked to.  This way you can keep all of your  information (the app, bookmarks, cache, etc) all secure within your home directory.  Also, while we’re at it, recommended settings for  Firefox include things like Privacy (don’t remember history, always clear private data when you close Firefox)  and Security (use a master password) so you don’t leave anything behind.</li><br></ul></p>\n<p><ul><br>    <li>Use IEtab for Firefox (<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1419\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1419</a>) - once you have Firefox installed you’ll have a myriad of plugins to choose from to  further enhance your browsing experience.  In a corporate environment there’s always going to be that Intranet  page or some other site that you <em>need</em> to have IE to use.  While hacking the user agent in Firefox is fun, it  doesn’t always work, so instead install IEtab.  Now a click on an icon in Firefox will switch the rendering  engine to IE, all within the confines of Firefox.</li><br></ul></p>\n<p><ul><br>    <li>Password safe (<a href=\"http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/</a>) - originally developed by security consultant Bruce  Schneider, Password Safe is a must have to house your various passwords.  Never write down your password on a  post it note again (ever).  Easy to use .exe to run that creates the encrypted database file on the fly.  Put  those together somewhere and you’ll have everything secure in one place.</li><br></ul></p>\n<p><ul><br>    <li>Xming (<a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming</a>) - the most up-to-date and advanced X server for Windows, simple  to setup with some nice features.</li><br></ul></p>\n<p><ul><br>    <li>PuTTY (<a href=\"http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</a>) - unless you’re running your own X server (which  is recommended), this is the SSH client of choice for win32 users.  Also, since it’s so portable, it’s good to  have on hand for backup, you never know when you might need it.  Also, there is also now a newer variant called  Putty Tray (<a href=\"http://www.xs4all.nl/~whaa/putty/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://www.xs4all.nl/~whaa/putty/</a>) that integrates better with Windows, and has a few additional  features.</li><br></ul></p>\n<p><ul><br>    <li>Cygwin (<a href=\"http://www.cygwin.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://www.cygwin.com/</a>) - from the site, “Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows.” and it’s  just that, it allows you to use all the GNU tools you’re used to within the Linux environment, to control  Windows.</li><br></ul></p>\n<p><ul><br>    <li>Launchy (<a href=\"http://www.launchy.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://www.launchy.net/</a>) - much like the great Quicksilver on Macs, Launchy allows you to launch apps  with just a few key strokes.  Easy to use, a breeze to configure to point to apps in unusual (read ~/bin)  places, and always a conversation starter when I open Explorer by typing ‘ex’.  It is now a ‘must have’ app for  me when I have to use Windows.</li><br></ul></p>\n<p><ul><br>    <li>XAMPP (<a href=\"http://www.apachefriends.org/en/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://www.apachefriends.org/en/index.html</a>) - from a group calling themselves Apache Friends, XAMPP is  a single package that contains Apache, MySQL, Perl and PHP all bound together with a simple dashboard to  control it all.  If you want to quickly develop some proof of concept or just provide a Wiki to share your  documentation, this is the easiest way to do it.  It all runs out of one directory, so there’s no need to  ‘install’ anything.  It contains scripts to launch at startup as part of the Services if you need to.</li><br></ul></p>\n<p><ul><br>    <li>Use alt-tab to switch applications - as my use of Launchy should allude to, I use the keyboard to switch  windows constantly; trust me, it’s the only way to fly.  Start getting used to that and your productivity will  increase in all desktop environments, it’s a standard and it leads to (belive it or not) a better UI to work in.  How?  Read III. UI to find out.</li><br></ul><br><strong>III. UI</strong></p>\n<p>You know what I think of XP’s default theme, but even the old one looks like a photocopy of a photocopy (insert comment about Xerox’s first desktop here), and is ripe for improvement.</p>\n<p><ul><br>    <li>Remove icons from the desktop - this relates to the alt-tab and Launchy hints; if you have to hunt and peck  for a shortcut to start an app, you’re already way behind from where you should be.  Learn alt-tab, use  Launchy, keep your desk blank.</li><br></ul></p>\n<p><ul><br>    <li>Hide the taskbar - again, you don’t need it, no more ‘Start -&gt; Programs’ or clicking on the  minimized  windows widget; it’s already take care of by our friends alt-tab and Launchy (see a trend here?)</li><br></ul></p>\n<p><ul><br>    <li>Use Blackbox for Windows (<a href=\"http://www.bb4win.org/news.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://www.bb4win.org/news.php</a>) - the minimalist window manager from the *nix days,  Blackbox, is a great replacement to the explorer shell.  This will allow you to have decorations that differ  from the standard <em> |</em>| X that you’ve had for so many years, and will take up less space.  You also gain the  menu visible by right clicking anywhere on the desktop which gives you access to the full ‘Start -&gt; Programs’  dealio, plus ‘Control Panel’ and even those shortcuts you put on the task bar and never used.  While it doesn’t  look like any of the projects (found under ‘Latest Releases’) are being regularly updated, don’t be fooled,  people are still working on many projects for the bb4win community, and even more so are using a Blackbox  derivative for their shell.  It’s completely functional and stable, even when running on top of explorer (you  can’t see it, but it’s still there, you’re Windows taskbar will still be available, just hidden at the bottom  of your window.  I am currently running BBLean 1.16z - an oldie that much of the newer development is being  based on, and you can find tons of cool Styles that are easy to install on this site: <a href=\"http://www.boxshots.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://www.boxshots.org/</a></li><br></ul></p>\n<p><ul><br>    <li>Use Jimmac cursors - pretty much all of the Linux distros these days use Jimmac’s XFree cursors by default  and for good reason, they rock.  It’s easy to install these under XP, and you’ll be glad you did.  I wrote a  complete HOWTO a while back that walks you through the process here: <a href=\"http://fak3r.com/2007/06/21/howto-jimmac-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://fak3r.com/2007/06/21/howto-jimmac-</a> mouse-cursors-on-xp/</li><br></ul></p>\n<p><ul><br>    <li>Use a NASA image for a  wallpaper (<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/Previous_images_of_the_Day_Collection_archive_1.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/Previous_images_of_the_Day_Collection_archive_1.html</a>) - take a look through the archives of great NASA images, most have a large version and make for incredible looking wallpapers.  Break out of the Digital Blashphony rut…for good.</li><br></ul><br><strong>IV. EXTRA CREDIT</strong></p>\n<p>For those who want to go the extra mile, here are some final ways to make your computer usage more useful at  work.  As always keep in mind your company policy on acceptable use, I can’t take any responsibility for  injuries, damage, explosions, blah, blah, blah.</p>\n<p><ul><br>    <li>Firefox 3 - while still in Beta I can attest to it being much more responsive, and far less resource hungry  (read no more memory leak), than 2 ever was.  Heck, even in it’s current Beta state I’d recommend it if there  aren’t any plugins you have to have from 2.</li><br></ul></p>\n<p><ul><br>    <li>Compose all emails in plain text - don’t compose emails in HTML, or even Outlook’s default RTF, use plain  text, as it’s supposed to be.  Repeat after me, “Email is not an FTP protocol, Email is not an FTP protocol…”</li><br></ul></p>\n<p><ul><br>    <li>Disable resource stealing monitoring software - investigate suspicious entries in Task Manager, try to kill  them, if that fails dig into the registry and try to stop them from starting, then reboot.  Again, ensure that  this doesn’t infringe on any ‘acceptable use’ guidelines at your place of employment first!</li><br></ul></p>\n<p><ul><br>    <li>TrueCrypt (<a href=\"http://www.truecrypt.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://www.truecrypt.org/</a>) - encrypt a section of your harddrive if for no other reason than to  annoy your IT department.  Keep your copy of Password Safe within it, and run it out of there for extra  protection.  It even has support for a ‘hidden volume’ so if you’re forced to give up your passkey they can  look and not see any of the ‘real’ secret data you have.  Ooo, how l33t you are!  So don’t try to be smug about  it, but you know you’re a badass, so you might as well flaunt it a little bit.</li><br></ul></p>\n<p><ul><br>    <li>BSOD wallpaper - find a nice Blue Screen Of Death image that will fit as a wallpaper from somewhere like  Google Images: <a href=\"http://images.google.com/images?q=bsod&amp;svnum=10&amp;um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;sa=N&amp;imgsz=xxlarge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://images.google.com/images?q=bsod&amp;svnum=10&amp;um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;sa=N&amp;imgsz=xxlarge</a> -  again, a nice conversation starter.</li><br></ul></p>\n<p><ul><br>    <li>Evangelize Linux - I highly recommend asking about running Linux on your workstation, at least as a pilot.   While the outcome is usually not a positive one, it can demonstrate to others that you want to improve the  environment, save some bucks for the company or more.  In the least it can give them an idea to keep you in mind  if anything Linux-y comes up in the future.  But I really recommend asking about running Linux on during the  interview process.  Remember, when you’re in an interview you should be looking at them as hard as they’re  looking at you; is this where you want to work, with the constraints laid out ahead of time?  Again, as above,  it shows that you’re “thinking outside of the box” (I hate that one) with new ideas.  At the very worst they’ll  despise you for asking and not hire you, which is perfect since why you wouldn’t be happy working for people  that close minded.</li><br></ul><br><strong>V. CONCLUSION</strong></p>\n<p>I hope this guide has prepared you to better deal with Windows XP in the workplace, or at least made you realize that your hatered is shared among many.  Let’s face it, it’s not the best tool for  the job, but as long as you have to use it you might as well take control of it to make it run better, and be less annoying to deal with.  Maybe you’ll find a place to work that allows, or even encourages, the use of Linux or Apple, and there are  places are out there, and that will certainly help you survive your time with XP.</p>\n<p>Do you have a suggestion that I haven’t covered?

RESOURCES</strong>\n\nWith each iteration of Windows needing more and more memory is required (which contrasts nicely with Linux),  so it is essential to make sure nothing is running on your system that you don't need.  Unfortunately Microsoft  and other 3rd party providers (RealPlayer, Apple I'm looking at you) love to have things run on your rig at  bootup to ensure they leech your system resources fulltime.  Let's rip those stole ways outta there!\n<ul>\n\t<li>Stop things from starting - one of the most infuriating things about having to run Windows is when an  installer puts a shortcut in your startup folder. This eats up your system resources and is usually only there so  the app will 'launch faster' when you need it.  Well duh, it's already running, so sure it's going to pop up  quickly!  Go to 'Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Startup' and delete all of those entries (anything with the words quick  or fast are likely resource hogs, kill em all)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li><img src=\"http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/system-tray-thumb1.jpg\" alt=\"Full system tray\" align=\"right\" />Kill all icons in the system tray - I love it when you get a glance at a co-worker's desktop to see that they have 20 icons in their system tray down by the clock, each one of them a placeholder for some  usually useless application that is leeching system resources while providing no benefit.  These are  usually the result of those 'startup' items we killed on the previous step, but there are plenty of other ways  for them to be started up.  First we try and reason with them, right click on each icon and try to figure out how to 'opt-out' of those lame things starting up.   If you fail to figure all of them out, don't worry some are a bit more deceptive than others, we'll fix them later.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Kill the services - now we'll look at the big services starting up on boot as part of Windows.  Go to 'Start  -&gt; Settings -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Services'  What needs to be running?  Turn off what you  don't need, investigate the ones you aren't sure about.  another option for this is the more consumer friendly msconfig - activate it with Start -&gt; Run 'msconfig'.  Look at the last tab, 'Startup' for a simplified version of Services.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Lastly - HACK the registry, maliciously! - last step in reclaiming system resources is to hack the registry to stop  things from running on boot; if you haven't stopped them yet, this is the last ditch effort to shake them.  To  get into regedit you just need to go to 'Start -&gt; Run' and then type 'regedit'. Nervous types will want to make  a backup of the current registry in case of some disaster, to do this just click on 'File -&gt; Export' and save  the .reg file for backup.  Once in regedit we need to expand the tree to get to the startup section, so click  on 'My Computer -&gt; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -&gt; SOFTWARE -&gt; Microsoft -&gt; Windows -&gt; CurrentVersion -&gt; Run'  Whew, ok,  take a look at the list, it should be obvious what you need to keep.  Anything that isn't anti-virus or related  to logging into the network is usually junk, but take care not to take out anything that you don't know what  it does before some Googling.  I've become quite bullish on ripping stuff out, but that comes with years of  having to deal with this junk.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>II. APPLICATIONS</strong>\n\nThere are a number of applications I use and recommend others use to help make Windows work better (or just act  more like Linux), and they're all free.  Generally I'll create a 'bin' directory within My Documents to install  my new apps to, just so I can keep a tighter leash on them.\n<ul>\n\t<li> Firefox (http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable) - this is a no brainier, use Firefox, it's better.  For use in an office environment I recommend using the Firefox available from Portable Apps, as I've linked to.  This way you can keep all of your  information (the app, bookmarks, cache, etc) all secure within your home directory.  Also, while we're at it, recommended settings for  Firefox include things like Privacy (don't remember history, always clear private data when you close Firefox)  and Security (use a master password) so you don't leave anything behind.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Use IEtab for Firefox (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1419) - once you have Firefox installed you'll have a myriad of plugins to choose from to  further enhance your browsing experience.  In a corporate environment there's always going to be that Intranet  page or some other site that you _need_ to have IE to use.  While hacking the user agent in Firefox is fun, it  doesn't always work, so instead install IEtab.  Now a click on an icon in Firefox will switch the rendering  engine to IE, all within the confines of Firefox.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Password safe (http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/) - originally developed by security consultant Bruce  Schneider, Password Safe is a must have to house your various passwords.  Never write down your password on a  post it note again (ever).  Easy to use .exe to run that creates the encrypted database file on the fly.  Put  those together somewhere and you'll have everything secure in one place.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Xming (http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming) - the most up-to-date and advanced X server for Windows, simple  to setup with some nice features.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>PuTTY (http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) - unless you're running your own X server (which  is recommended), this is the SSH client of choice for win32 users.  Also, since it's so portable, it's good to  have on hand for backup, you never know when you might need it.  Also, there is also now a newer variant called  Putty Tray (http://www.xs4all.nl/~whaa/putty/) that integrates better with Windows, and has a few additional  features.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/) - from the site, \"Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows.\" and it's  just that, it allows you to use all the GNU tools you're used to within the Linux environment, to control  Windows.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Launchy (http://www.launchy.net/) - much like the great Quicksilver on Macs, Launchy allows you to launch apps  with just a few key strokes.  Easy to use, a breeze to configure to point to apps in unusual (read ~/bin)  places, and always a conversation starter when I open Explorer by typing 'ex'.  It is now a 'must have' app for  me when I have to use Windows.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>XAMPP (http://www.apachefriends.org/en/index.html) - from a group calling themselves Apache Friends, XAMPP is  a single package that contains Apache, MySQL, Perl and PHP all bound together with a simple dashboard to  control it all.  If you want to quickly develop some proof of concept or just provide a Wiki to share your  documentation, this is the easiest way to do it.  It all runs out of one directory, so there's no need to  'install' anything.  It contains scripts to launch at startup as part of the Services if you need to.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Use alt-tab to switch applications - as my use of Launchy should allude to, I use the keyboard to switch  windows constantly; trust me, it's the only way to fly.  Start getting used to that and your productivity will  increase in all desktop environments, it's a standard and it leads to (belive it or not) a better UI to work in.  How?  Read III. UI to find out.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>III. UI</strong>\n\nYou know what I think of XP's default theme, but even the old one looks like a photocopy of a photocopy (insert comment about Xerox's first desktop here), and is ripe for improvement.\n<ul>\n\t<li>Remove icons from the desktop - this relates to the alt-tab and Launchy hints; if you have to hunt and peck  for a shortcut to start an app, you're already way behind from where you should be.  Learn alt-tab, use  Launchy, keep your desk blank.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Hide the taskbar - again, you don't need it, no more 'Start -&gt; Programs' or clicking on the  minimized  windows widget; it's already take care of by our friends alt-tab and Launchy (see a trend here?)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Use Blackbox for Windows (http://www.bb4win.org/news.php) - the minimalist window manager from the *nix days,  Blackbox, is a great replacement to the explorer shell.  This will allow you to have decorations that differ  from the standard _ |_| X that you've had for so many years, and will take up less space.  You also gain the  menu visible by right clicking anywhere on the desktop which gives you access to the full 'Start -&gt; Programs'  dealio, plus 'Control Panel' and even those shortcuts you put on the task bar and never used.  While it doesn't  look like any of the projects (found under 'Latest Releases') are being regularly updated, don't be fooled,  people are still working on many projects for the bb4win community, and even more so are using a Blackbox  derivative for their shell.  It's completely functional and stable, even when running on top of explorer (you  can't see it, but it's still there, you're Windows taskbar will still be available, just hidden at the bottom  of your window.  I am currently running BBLean 1.16z - an oldie that much of the newer development is being  based on, and you can find tons of cool Styles that are easy to install on this site: http://www.boxshots.org/</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Use Jimmac cursors - pretty much all of the Linux distros these days use Jimmac's XFree cursors by default  and for good reason, they rock.  It's easy to install these under XP, and you'll be glad you did.  I wrote a  complete HOWTO a while back that walks you through the process here: http://fak3r.com/2007/06/21/howto-jimmac- mouse-cursors-on-xp/</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Use a NASA image for a  wallpaper (http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/Previous_images_of_the_Day_Collection_archive_1.html) - take a look through the archives of great NASA images, most have a large version and make for incredible looking wallpapers.  Break out of the Digital Blashphony rut...for good.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>IV. EXTRA CREDIT</strong>\n\nFor those who want to go the extra mile, here are some final ways to make your computer usage more useful at  work.  As always keep in mind your company policy on acceptable use, I can't take any responsibility for  injuries, damage, explosions, blah, blah, blah.\n<ul>\n\t<li>Firefox 3 - while still in Beta I can attest to it being much more responsive, and far less resource hungry  (read no more memory leak), than 2 ever was.  Heck, even in it's current Beta state I'd recommend it if there  aren't any plugins you have to have from 2.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Compose all emails in plain text - don't compose emails in HTML, or even Outlook's default RTF, use plain  text, as it's supposed to be.  Repeat after me, \"Email is not an FTP protocol, Email is not an FTP protocol...\"</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Disable resource stealing monitoring software - investigate suspicious entries in Task Manager, try to kill  them, if that fails dig into the registry and try to stop them from starting, then reboot.  Again, ensure that  this doesn't infringe on any 'acceptable use' guidelines at your place of employment first!</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>TrueCrypt (http://www.truecrypt.org/) - encrypt a section of your harddrive if for no other reason than to  annoy your IT department.  Keep your copy of Password Safe within it, and run it out of there for extra  protection.  It even has support for a 'hidden volume' so if you're forced to give up your passkey they can  look and not see any of the 'real' secret data you have.  Ooo, how l33t you are!  So don't try to be smug about  it, but you know you're a badass, so you might as well flaunt it a little bit.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>BSOD wallpaper - find a nice Blue Screen Of Death image that will fit as a wallpaper from somewhere like  Google Images: http://images.google.com/images?q=bsod&amp;svnum=10&amp;um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;sa=N&amp;imgsz=xxlarge -  again, a nice conversation starter.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Evangelize Linux - I highly recommend asking about running Linux on your workstation, at least as a pilot.   While the outcome is usually not a positive one, it can demonstrate to others that you want to improve the  environment, save some bucks for the company or more.  In the least it can give them an idea to keep you in mind  if anything Linux-y comes up in the future.  But I really recommend asking about running Linux on during the  interview process.  Remember, when you're in an interview you should be looking at them as hard as they're  looking at you; is this where you want to work, with the constraints laid out ahead of time?  Again, as above,  it shows that you're \"thinking outside of the box\" (I hate that one) with new ideas.  At the very worst they'll  despise you for asking and not hire you, which is perfect since why you wouldn't be happy working for people  that close minded.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>V. CONCLUSION</strong>\n\nI hope this guide has prepared you to better deal with Windows XP in the workplace, or at least made you realize that your hatered is shared among many.  Let's face it, it's not the best tool for  the job, but as long as you have to use it you might as well take control of it to make it run better, and be less annoying to deal with.  Maybe you'll find a place to work that allows, or even encourages, the use of Linux or Apple, and there are  places are out there, and that will certainly help you survive your time with XP.\n\nDo you have a suggestion that I haven't covered?  Some nugget of advice you've cultivated over the years of  indentured servitude to the MS behemoth?  Sound off in the comments.\n","slug":"5-steps-for-surviving-using-xp-in-the-workplace","updated":1414378977000,"excerpt":"<p>Ok, I’m not typical by any means when it comes to operating systems, but desktop systems - even less so.

I learned that using Apache2 -&gt; mod_proxy -&gt; lighttpd -&gt; fastcgi powered by <a href=\"http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Typo</a> for blogging  is a good enough combination to easily handle the traffic thrown it’s way.  Still, while my server was only running the Ruby process around 35%:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"title\">code</span>&gt;</span>51469 fak3r         1  99    0 38632K 32832K RUN  14:50 34.47% ruby<span class=\"tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"title\">code</span>&gt;</span>\n</code></pre><p>static pages were still taking ~60 seconds to refresh during peak load.

First of all the all important numbers; visits, pages, hits and transferred data for 2005-10-15, as reported by [Awstats](http://awstats.sourceforge.net/):\n\n\n\n\n    \n    <code>Date\t\tPages\t\tHits\t\tBandwidth\n    10-14-2005\t18092 \t\t95899 \t\t644.47 MB</code>\n\n\n\n\n\nHoly smokes, 95,899 hits for the day while transferring almost a cd's worth of data.  Again, not a huge number for a colo'd webserver with a big audience, but for a home built rig behind a 384/1.5 ADSL line, pretty cool.  Other interesting data gathered was:\n\n\n\n\n    \n    <code>Operating Systems (Top 10)\n    Operating Systems Hits Percent\n    Windows 80112 63.6 %\n    Linux 25319 20.1 %\n    Macintosh 14305 11.3 %\n    Unknown 5034 4 %\n    FreeBSD 741 0.5 %\n    Sun Solaris 278 0.2 %\n    OpenBSD 37 0 %\n    NetBSD 20 0 %\n    WebTV 1 0 %</code>\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was expected since it's a tech site, but it was still nice to see Linux so well represented (when I hit the site from work I'm coming in via XP unfortunately)\n\n\n\n\n    \n    <code>Browsers (Top 10)\n    Browsers Grabber Hits Percent\n    Firefox No 84168 66.8 %\n    MS Internet Explorer No 17268 13.7 %\n    Safari No 9715 7.7 %\n    Mozilla No 4509 3.5 %\n    Opera No 4011 3.1 %\n    Unknown ? 2867 2.2 %\n    Konqueror No 1278 1 %\n    Camino No 555 0.4 %\n    Galeon No 405 0.3 %\n    Netscape No 307 0.2 %\n    Others 764 0.6 %</code>\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, same disclaimer, but it would be nice if Firefox were the rule, and not the exception for the general public.\n\nSo what did I learn?  I learned that my FreeBSD 6.0 box is setup well enough to handle *at least* 100,000 hits a day.  I learned that using Apache2 -> mod_proxy -> lighttpd -> fastcgi powered by [Typo](http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac/) for blogging  is a good enough combination to easily handle the traffic thrown it's way.  Still, while my server was only running the Ruby process around 35%:\n\n\n\n\n    \n    <code>51469 fak3r         1  99    0 38632K 32832K RUN  14:50 34.47% ruby</code>\n\n\n\n\n\nstatic pages were still taking ~60 seconds to refresh during peak load.  Thankfully my ssh tunnel held up, so I was watching top and tailing the logs in real time.  From this I could see that everything was setup to handle the traffic, with headroom to spare, expect for my ADSL line, which still performed as expected.  It was indeed the bottleneck, but the fact that pages were still being severed (albeit slowly) showed it handled the traffic and served pages to all that would wait for them.

During shutdown, Varnish removes this shared object since it will be rebuilt during the next start. This routine repeats regardless of if anything has changed in the VCL config file, and serves as a road bump to getting Varnish into certain production environments since traditionally development applications (such as the C compiler) are not allowed in such instances. For now I am putting aside the arguments as to why it’s is acceptable to have development applications in production instances, since that argument’s outcome will vary in different situations, and I am aiming for a solution that will cover all instances.<br><a id=\"more\"></a><br>My proposal is to allow Varnish to reuse its shared object, instead creating it during on launch, and destroying it on shutdown.

The few we do we tell them that they're not allowed to call, and put us on the do-not-call list, they comply.

I’ve read about how much faster Lighttpd is, but today I wanted to test it out on my own enviroment in the hopes that it would convince me to migrate over, if for nothing else that to learn a new webserver.

It seems that this tiered or ‘naked DSL’ is only being offered up by AT&amp;T as part of the “…<em>concessions made by AT&amp;T to the Federal Communications Commission to get its $86 billion acquisition of BellSouth Corp. approved last <img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/aybatt.jpg\" alt=\"ayb att\">December</em>.” The speeds are what you’d expect for the price, 768 kilobits per second and upload speeds of up to 128 kbps, but this is far and away fast enough for 90% of subscribers I bet, the ‘speed’ that they try to sell is not something a normal user is going to bump up against.  In what makes it seem even more of a concession instead of a new marketing initiate is that, “<em>The plan was not mentioned in a Friday news release about AT&amp;T’s DSL plans, and is slightly hidden on the AT&amp;T Web site.

I always have these grand designs of writting a short paragragh about each selection, why I picked it, how I first heard it, etc, but you know how that goes.  I will say that this year, while I’ve gotten into many bands the way I have in years past (trolling record stores, randomly listening to anything I can find online), I’ve also found things I wouldn’t have found thanks to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/fak3r\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">my Twitter account</a>.  While those who don’t get  Twitter think it’s just folks updating what they had for breakfast, if you stick around, dig deeper and find the right people to follow, it’s amazing wealth of information.  Not requiring the effort of say a blog post allows rapid, unvarnished opinions, spouted out between people’s day to day tasks, which I always prefer since I feel I’m more lucid after a few cups of coffee while something is blaring in my ears.

I’m also enjoying the home stereo even more now with my early 70s <a href=\"http://www.roger-russell.com/amppre.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">McIntosh MA-6100</a> pre-amp/amp, and now even some respectable headphones for work, the <a href=\"http://www.gradolabs.com/frameset_main.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Grado SR60i</a>. This year bands <strong>introduced via Twitter</strong> from other music freaks have greatly helped diversify my palate. I can highly recommend the following for this: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/captainsdead\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">@captainsdead</a>, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/Truersound\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">@truersound</a> and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/somevelvetblog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">@somevelvetblog</a>. (if have other suggestions, leave them in the comments!) So here are the releases that I spent the most time with in 2010, each with a track from each release for you to hear/sample. Leave me feedback as to how my tastes compare to yours, as well as anything I may have missed. Finally, as always with music, see the bands when you can and <strong>buy locally, buy often</strong>.</p>\n<p>1-2-3-4…GO!<br><a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p>[caption id=”attachment_2604” align=”aligncenter” width=”200” caption=”Arcade Fire “The Suburbs””]<img src=\"http://fak3r.com/files/2010/12/thesuburbs200.jpg\" alt=\"Arcade Fire &quot;The Suburbs&quot;

Well, those people can eat it. Adele simply has an amazing voice and this album has two songs that slay me – Lovesong, one of the best Cure covers ever and Someone Like You, which almost always makes my heart hit the floor whenever I hear it. If you can’t get over yourself and appreciate a truly gifted singer, then you’re missing out.</em>“ So ya, you’ve heard her, you either like her or not, but <strong>you can’t deny her talent</strong>. I don’t think I would have completely fallen for her if not for Scott, so thanks again, you get credit bud, as usual!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41aOLq8XLnL._SL500_AA300_.jpg\" alt=\"\"><strong>Beastie Boys “Hot Sauce Committee Part 2”</strong> the long awaited return yeilds a come back of sorts, with a strong effort, wish they would tour more, but as long as they keep putting out stuff like this, I’m fine. <strong>A return to form that is still fun to hear after all these years</strong>. Listening to Listened to Ill all those years ago never prepared me for what they had in store all these years later (I can’t imagine they did either). </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61pUUM9%2BKdL._SL500_AA300_.jpg\" alt=\"\"><strong>BOAT “Dress Like Your Idols”</strong> this one is just plain fun, the low fi approach seems to be their tack, but here it’s more on style instead of sound. It works, and <strong>it’s fun</strong>, I like this. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c7/Heavy_Rocks_(2011_album\" alt=\"\">.jpg/220px-Heavy<em>Rocks</em>(2011_album).jpg)<strong>Boris “Heavy Rocks”</strong> yes, they do, and this <strong>mostly instrumental sludge rock from Japan</strong> is their best effort since their watermark “Pink”. They’ve had two other releases this year, both going in a more pop, less abrasive direction, will be interesting to see where it takes them. This is a band I would really love to see live one day. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Tcs4BpaDL._SL500_AA300_.jpg\" alt=\"\"><strong>Jimmy Cliff “Sacred Fire EP”</strong> the quick back-story on this, reggae legend Jimmy Cliff (63 years young) recorded his new album with Tim Armstrong of Rancid producing, and that is due out March 2012. This EP was put out for the black Friday Record Store Day promotion as a teaser, but it contains b-sides including covers of The Clash’s “The Guns of Brixton” (a song where <em>they</em> namecheck Cliff’s’ role in the 70s movie, and subsequent album, <em>The Harder They Come</em>), Bob Dylan’s “A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall” and even a Rancid cover, the already reggae sounding “Rudy Soho”. In every case <strong>Cliff makes the song his own, with more successes than not</strong> on this short sampler. This really makes me excited for his new release, he seems to be ready to really take on anything, hopefully proper tour too! Here’s his Rancid cover, ‘Rudy Soho’, which is just so much fun!  and his version of The Clash’s ‘Guns of Brixton’ </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5f/Pjharveyletenglandshake.jpg/220px-Pjharveyletenglandshake.jpg\" alt=\"\"><strong>PJ Harvey “Let England Shake”</strong> if you know me you know I love PJ, I have since her first release and first saw her live in Chicago in 1991. She’s a true artis who has changed direction and style over the years without caring for musical trends. This one had to grow on me, <strong>now I put it in with her top 4 best</strong> (with “Is This Desire?” still at #1). This release won her the <a href=\"http://www.mercuryprize.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Mercury Prize</a>, which she won previously for 2001’s “Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea”. She is the only person to ever win it twice. Awesome.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61yGq0MjZCL._SL500_AA300_.jpg\" alt=\"\"><strong>Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit “Here We Rest” </strong>some <strong>beautiful songs and tons of variety</strong> highlight this singer-songwriter’s latest effort. I’m lacking on any earlier stuff from him, but if this is any indication, I’m going to have to checkout more. He’s opening for Ryan Adams in January in St. Louis, and I’m still on the fence about going to that one…we’ll see. Of course I have to give credit to Amada Shires, who besides participating in his touring band, has tweeted about him so much that I had to give him some attention. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.nashvillescene.com/binary/12be/1288188352-jeffthebrotherhood_wearethechampions.jpg\" alt=\"\"><strong>Jeff The Brotherhood “We Are The Champions”</strong> this one snuck up on my while I browsed the racks at <a href=\"http://www.euclidrecords.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Euclid Records</a> by my house. After 20 mins I had to ask who it was, and they told me it was a band from Nashville called Jeff The Brotherhood. Such fun stuff, sometimes grungy, sometimes with a Ramones streak, this album is a ton of fun. In this live clip I think you’ll agree, <strong>the fog machine is warranted!</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Vsk628lqL._SL500_AA300_.jpg\" alt=\"\"><strong>Lykke Li “Wounded Ryhmes”</strong> a step up from her brilliant debut release, I suspect her voice is a barrier for some, but give her work a chance, and <strong>you’ll be pleasantly surprised</strong>. Most of her songs are this delicate, and build up slowly. She has an almost PJ quality if I do say so, and that’s always recommended. Looking forward to seeing how she changes in the future. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://assets3.subpop.com/assets/images/main/8238.jpg\" alt=\"\"><strong>Mogwai “Hardcore Will Never Die, But You Will”</strong> not their strongest release, but like their previous release, “The Hawk is Howling”, this really grew on me. They take a side step using some different elements here, some electronics which worried me, but in the end<strong> it’s still Mogwai, and I love it</strong>. Also, this album has to be on of the best titles ever, it’s almost tattoo worthy :)</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/24/The_king_of_limbs.jpg/220px-The_king_of_limbs.jpg\" alt=\"\"><strong>Radiohead “King of Limbs” / Radiohead “TKOL RMX 1234567”</strong> so another year, another amazing Radiohead release. <strong>I don’t know how they do it, but they do, I always fall for their stuff</strong>, regardless of the stylistic changes they force upon us. I put TKOL RMX in there too, because while it’s a double CD of remixes of all of the King of Limbs songs, I still listen to it almost as much as the proper album. That’s never happened with a remix CD, and it took me completely by surprise. They’re also releasing a DVD of their performance of this on From the Basement, so look for that, and I’ll be seeing them playing live again in March - cannot wait!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://store.sideonedummy.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/c/h/chuck_ragan_covering_ground_cover.jpg\" alt=\"\"><strong>Chuck Ragan “Covering Ground”</strong> all I knew about Chuck Ragan before I saw him was that he was formerly of <em>Hot Water Music</em> and he was a singer-songwriter. That he was opening for <em>Social Distortion</em> gave me pause, but I assumed Mike Ness knew what he was doing when he picked him as an opener, and wow, did he ever. The three piece came on after a loud, poppy fun set from UK’s <em>Sharks</em> (see below) with acoustic guitar, standup bass and fiddle to floor us with songs that I loved on the first listen. The fact that the bassist and fiddler knew their craft helped too, sure, but <strong>his songs, his stories, are very strong</strong>. This live performance of ‘Nomad By Fate’ says it all, just killer.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.shopradiocast.com/product_images/w/132/sharks__84046_zoom.jpg\" alt=\"\"><strong>Sharks “The Joys of Living 2008-2010”</strong> so, as I just mentioned, the UK band <em>Sharks</em> opened the <em>Social Distortion</em> show, and it was definitely more in line with what I was expecting, but much, much better too. Pop, punk, with newer sounding <em>Clash</em> style hooks were just perfect. I bought their CD and a t shirt from them, the CD turned out to be a collection of their EPs, but it stands as a solid disk and does not sound like a young band at all. By the way, this is by far <strong>the disk I listened to most last year</strong>. Their first full player will be out in March, I know they’ve been touring with <em>SocD</em> some more, but they aren’t hitting St. Louis on this leg. I’m looking for them to do a headlining stop here, here’s hoping! So here’s <em>Sharks</em> ‘The Light at the End of the Tunnel is Hell’</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://images.hitfix.com/photos/576232/Social-Distortion--Hard-Times-and-Nursery-Rhymes_event_main.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><strong>Social Distortion “Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes”</strong> yes, yes, so here we are, <em>SocialD</em>, as mentioned a few times above now, put on a great show, as always, that was just a topper for a great night of music. I’ve dug <em>SocialD</em> back in the late 80s, and while their sound has… matured, they show live that they still have it. And by they I mean Mike Ness, really the only long time member, but the main writer the whole time, so that counts. I wouldn’t put this disc up there with oldies like “Prison Bounnd” or “Mommy’s Little Monster”, but <strong>it’s damn good, and their best effort in many years.</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F4BXYU%2BEL._SL500_AA300_.jpg\" alt=\"\"><strong>Amanda Shires “Carrying Lightning”</strong> I can’t remember where I came across Amanda Shires, but it was the video for ‘When You Need a Train It Never Comes’ that I saw first, and <strong>I was hooked right away</strong>. Her songs are so…sincere, and the stories and pictures they sketch0out are so…relate-able. I quickly got her CD after rolling through this video countless times, and I was really happy to see that this was it was equally as engaging. I love this song, and it’s just a great video.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile she did a solo version of ‘Swimmer’, the track that kicks off the album, and it gives you a feel for her raw talent.

That’s not to compare the styles; <em>Skillex’s</em> dubstep sound will never be seen as old genre, this feels cutting edge, and is <strong>as exciting and rush inducing as a heart attack</strong> (I imagine). My friend Scott commented that some of it sounded like the <em>Transformers</em> movie with the beasts walking down the street, and I see that - it fits. Also, I’m a big fan of tempo changes, and when this on this one changes, hold on!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41z%2BD%2BJNtBL._SL500_AA300_.jpg\" alt=\"\"><strong>Wild Flag “Wild Flag”</strong> yep, I miss <em>Sleater-Kinney</em>, and hope they reform sometime in the future, but for now 2/3 of them are doing this, and Carrie just seems <strong>so much more ‘out there’ and comfortable, it’s a joy</strong>. Most of the songs have a much more angluar, sharp feel to them, but the chorus still takes me back to S-K, so it feels new, but instantly familiar at the same time. I was jealous when they were playing live for <em>SXSW</em> this year, I missed out, and they made no St. Louis stop (BOOO!) but they sure looked like they were having fun. This video tells the story better than I do, they look like they’re having a blast, and just rawking out.</p>\n<p>So what do you think? What did I miss that you couldn’t live without this year?

Well, those people can eat it. Adele simply has an amazing voice and this album has two songs that slay me – Lovesong, one of the best Cure covers ever and Someone Like You, which almost always makes my heart hit the floor whenever I hear it. If you can’t get over yourself and appreciate a truly gifted singer, then you’re missing out._\" So ya, you've heard her, you either like her or not, but **you can't deny her talent**. I don't think I would have completely fallen for her if not for Scott, so thanks again, you get credit bud, as usual!\n\n\n\n\n\n![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41aOLq8XLnL._SL500_AA300_.jpg)**Beastie Boys \"Hot Sauce Committee Part 2\"** the long awaited return yeilds a come back of sorts, with a strong effort, wish they would tour more, but as long as they keep putting out stuff like this, I'm fine. **A return to form that is still fun to hear after all these years**. Listening to Listened to Ill all those years ago never prepared me for what they had in store all these years later (I can't imagine they did either). \n\n\n\n\n\n![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61pUUM9%2BKdL._SL500_AA300_.jpg)**BOAT \"Dress Like Your Idols\"** this one is just plain fun, the low fi approach seems to be their tack, but here it's more on style instead of sound. It works, and **it's fun**, I like this. \n\n\n\n\n\n![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c7/Heavy_Rocks_(2011_album).jpg/220px-Heavy_Rocks_(2011_album).jpg)**Boris \"Heavy Rocks\"** yes, they do, and this **mostly instrumental sludge rock from Japan** is their best effort since their watermark \"Pink\". They've had two other releases this year, both going in a more pop, less abrasive direction, will be interesting to see where it takes them. This is a band I would really love to see live one day. \n\n\n\n\n\n![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Tcs4BpaDL._SL500_AA300_.jpg)**Jimmy Cliff \"Sacred Fire EP\"** the quick back-story on this, reggae legend Jimmy Cliff (63 years young) recorded his new album with Tim Armstrong of Rancid producing, and that is due out March 2012. This EP was put out for the black Friday Record Store Day promotion as a teaser, but it contains b-sides including covers of The Clash's \"The Guns of Brixton\" (a song where _they_ namecheck Cliff's' role in the 70s movie, and subsequent album, _The Harder They Come_), Bob Dylan's \"A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall\" and even a Rancid cover, the already reggae sounding \"Rudy Soho\". In every case **Cliff makes the song his own, with more successes than not** on this short sampler. This really makes me excited for his new release, he seems to be ready to really take on anything, hopefully proper tour too! Here's his Rancid cover, 'Rudy Soho', which is just so much fun!  and his version of The Clash's 'Guns of Brixton' \n\n\n\n\n\n![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5f/Pjharveyletenglandshake.jpg/220px-Pjharveyletenglandshake.jpg)**PJ Harvey \"Let England Shake\"** if you know me you know I love PJ, I have since her first release and first saw her live in Chicago in 1991. She's a true artis who has changed direction and style over the years without caring for musical trends. This one had to grow on me, **now I put it in with her top 4 best** (with \"Is This Desire?\" still at #1). This release won her the [Mercury Prize](http://www.mercuryprize.com/), which she won previously for 2001's \"Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea\". She is the only person to ever win it twice. Awesome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61yGq0MjZCL._SL500_AA300_.jpg)**Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit \"Here We Rest\" **some **beautiful songs and tons of variety** highlight this singer-songwriter's latest effort. I'm lacking on any earlier stuff from him, but if this is any indication, I'm going to have to checkout more. He's opening for Ryan Adams in January in St. Louis, and I'm still on the fence about going to that one...we'll see. Of course I have to give credit to Amada Shires, who besides participating in his touring band, has tweeted about him so much that I had to give him some attention. \n\n\n\n\n\n![](http://www.nashvillescene.com/binary/12be/1288188352-jeffthebrotherhood_wearethechampions.jpg)**Jeff The Brotherhood \"We Are The Champions\"** this one snuck up on my while I browsed the racks at [Euclid Records](http://www.euclidrecords.com/) by my house. After 20 mins I had to ask who it was, and they told me it was a band from Nashville called Jeff The Brotherhood. Such fun stuff, sometimes grungy, sometimes with a Ramones streak, this album is a ton of fun. In this live clip I think you'll agree, **the fog machine is warranted!**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Vsk628lqL._SL500_AA300_.jpg)**Lykke Li \"Wounded Ryhmes\"** a step up from her brilliant debut release, I suspect her voice is a barrier for some, but give her work a chance, and **you'll be pleasantly surprised**. Most of her songs are this delicate, and build up slowly. She has an almost PJ quality if I do say so, and that's always recommended. Looking forward to seeing how she changes in the future. \n\n\n\n\n\n![](http://assets3.subpop.com/assets/images/main/8238.jpg)**Mogwai \"Hardcore Will Never Die, But You Will\"** not their strongest release, but like their previous release, \"The Hawk is Howling\", this really grew on me. They take a side step using some different elements here, some electronics which worried me, but in the end** it's still Mogwai, and I love it**. Also, this album has to be on of the best titles ever, it's almost tattoo worthy :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/24/The_king_of_limbs.jpg/220px-The_king_of_limbs.jpg)**Radiohead \"King of Limbs\" / Radiohead \"TKOL RMX 1234567\"** so another year, another amazing Radiohead release. **I don't know how they do it, but they do, I always fall for their stuff**, regardless of the stylistic changes they force upon us. I put TKOL RMX in there too, because while it's a double CD of remixes of all of the King of Limbs songs, I still listen to it almost as much as the proper album. That's never happened with a remix CD, and it took me completely by surprise. They're also releasing a DVD of their performance of this on From the Basement, so look for that, and I'll be seeing them playing live again in March - cannot wait!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](http://store.sideonedummy.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/c/h/chuck_ragan_covering_ground_cover.jpg)**Chuck Ragan \"Covering Ground\"** all I knew about Chuck Ragan before I saw him was that he was formerly of _Hot Water Music_ and he was a singer-songwriter. That he was opening for _Social Distortion_ gave me pause, but I assumed Mike Ness knew what he was doing when he picked him as an opener, and wow, did he ever. The three piece came on after a loud, poppy fun set from UK's _Sharks_ (see below) with acoustic guitar, standup bass and fiddle to floor us with songs that I loved on the first listen. The fact that the bassist and fiddler knew their craft helped too, sure, but **his songs, his stories, are very strong**. This live performance of 'Nomad By Fate' says it all, just killer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](http://www.shopradiocast.com/product_images/w/132/sharks__84046_zoom.jpg)**Sharks \"The Joys of Living 2008-2010\"** so, as I just mentioned, the UK band _Sharks_ opened the _Social Distortion_ show, and it was definitely more in line with what I was expecting, but much, much better too. Pop, punk, with newer sounding _Clash_ style hooks were just perfect. I bought their CD and a t shirt from them, the CD turned out to be a collection of their EPs, but it stands as a solid disk and does not sound like a young band at all. By the way, this is by far **the disk I listened to most last year**. Their first full player will be out in March, I know they've been touring with _SocD_ some more, but they aren't hitting St. Louis on this leg. I'm looking for them to do a headlining stop here, here's hoping! So here's _Sharks_ 'The Light at the End of the Tunnel is Hell'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](http://images.hitfix.com/photos/576232/Social-Distortion--Hard-Times-and-Nursery-Rhymes_event_main.jpeg)**Social Distortion \"Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes\"** yes, yes, so here we are, _SocialD_, as mentioned a few times above now, put on a great show, as always, that was just a topper for a great night of music. I've dug _SocialD_ back in the late 80s, and while their sound has... matured, they show live that they still have it. And by they I mean Mike Ness, really the only long time member, but the main writer the whole time, so that counts. I wouldn't put this disc up there with oldies like \"Prison Bounnd\" or \"Mommy's Little Monster\", but **it's damn good, and their best effort in many years.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F4BXYU%2BEL._SL500_AA300_.jpg)**Amanda Shires \"Carrying Lightning\"** I can't remember where I came across Amanda Shires, but it was the video for 'When You Need a Train It Never Comes' that I saw first, and **I was hooked right away**. Her songs are so...sincere, and the stories and pictures they sketch0out are so...relate-able. I quickly got her CD after rolling through this video countless times, and I was really happy to see that this was it was equally as engaging. I love this song, and it's just a great video.\n\nMeanwhile she did a solo version of 'Swimmer', the track that kicks off the album, and it gives you a feel for her raw talent. So great, really hope she tours more and makes a St. Louis stop. Wonder if she's playing with Jason Isbell in January?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](http://www.dubstepeden.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Skrillex-More-Monsters-And-Sprites-.jpg)**Skrillex \"More Monsters And Sprites\"** this kid can write some songs, it re-awakens my love of electronic music since _Amon Tobin's_ groundbreaking first few releases.

I’ve seen ads poking fun at rabid crowds trying to break down doors before stores open to get the latest deals around the holidays, and it’s always some comment about how the store’s prices left the customers chomping at the bit to save that 15%.  Of course when parody becomes reality, it’s always ugly, and today had to be worst, aptly named, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_(shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Black Friday</a>) ever.  The reports of people getting violent in an effort to secure a cheap blue-ray dvd player, or flatscreen TV is enough to tell you things have gotten out of hand, but today there’s plenty of examples that show that this kind of frenzied shopping needs to end.  I’ve compiled as many as I can stand just to point out that is a systemic problem, and our consumerism culture has once again gone too far.</p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a>An <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/11/28/blackfri.irpt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">embedded CNN reporter</a> comments:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many people were fighting over kids’ clothes and other essentials […] “It was a sea of people,” said Rathburn, who hoped to buy a Nintendo Wii game system but went home empty-handed. He wasn’t impressed by the behavior of fellow customers. He said a woman accidentally bumped his back as she tried to compete with him while he examined $1.50 towels. He also said he watched as a customer swooped in to take a 42-inch TV and the unattended cart in which it was sitting. “I’m guessing that the spirit of giving for Christmas starts tomorrow,” he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From San Diego, <a href=\"http://www.themercury.com/news/article.aspx?articleId=24e7655a21114c83b6ecaae5ff18feb5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">the Mercury News</a> reports:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Navigation was difficult because unlike a normal day at Wal-Mart, everyone had a cart. “The worst part is there are carts,” said Sharon Hauck. Backs of heels get clipped from carts following too closely, hips get bumped from people moving around corner and not looking first and people can get fingers smashed when trying to squeeze past someone standing in the middle of the aisle. There have been national reports of shopping cart violence and fist fights over parking stalls in regard to Black Friday shopping.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Next up, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/25/business/25shop.html?ex=1322110800&amp;en=3b12a854964d3445&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">The New York Times</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Shortly after midnight yesterday, an estimated 15,000 shoppers pushed and shoved their way into the Fashion Place mall in Murray, Utah. Police soon joined them, responding to reports of nine skirmishes. Once inside, shoppers ransacked stores, overturning piles of clothes as they looked for bargains.

Backs of heels get clipped from carts following too closely, hips get bumped from people moving around corner and not looking first and people can get fingers smashed when trying to squeeze past someone standing in the middle of the aisle.

In the end I came up with a pretty current system, that Debian or Ubuntu will be 100% compatible with, and will be proud to call home. The detailed specs:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Intel Core 2 Duo T5470, 1.6GHz, 800Mhz FSB, 2M L2 Cache<br>15.4 inch Wide Screen XGA LCD display<br>1GB, DDR2, 667MHz 2 DIMM<br>128MB NVIDIA GeForce 8400M GS<br>120G 5400RPM SATA Hard Drive<br>Integrated 10/100 Network Cardand Modem<br>8X DVD+/-RW with double-layer DVD+R write capability<br>Integrated High Definition Audio 2.0<br>Intel 3945 WLAN (802.11a/g) Mini Card<br>Integrated 2.0 mega pixel webcam<br>Integrated Bluetooth<br>85 WHr 9-cell Lithium Ion Primary Battery</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is more system that I originally spec’d out, but the price was right, so I’m very happy.  Before I reveal which brand I picked, I’ll tell the interesting story of how I ended up with the ‘top I did, and how things compare for laptop Linux options these days, it’s an interesting ride.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: feel free to <a href=\"http://digg.com/linux_unix/Buying_a_Linux_laptop_in_2007\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Digg this article</a> if you like it.</p>\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/macbook.jpg\" alt=\"Macbook\">As I mentioned, my last laptop was the iBook that I’ve posted about often. While I liked it I had tons of trouble with it, however I know it’s specific to that model, so I’m not holding it against Apple; they’re still in the running, especially when you look at the sleek MacBooks. I picked the MacBook that had a DVD burner (aka ‘Superdrive’ on a Mac), which was one of my requirements, and while it has a faster proc, and some other components that were not up to my specs, it was closest to what I wanted. So the <a href=\"http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID?nnmm=browse&amp;mco=7B723640&amp;node=home/shop_mac/family/macbook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\"><strong>MacBook</strong></a><strong> would would be $1299</strong> - honestly way more than I am prepared to pay for a laptop (I paid ~$950 for my iBook - but times have changed), and I feel I am paying a premium for an Apple, when I’m not even going to use OS X. So while the hardware would be mostly compatible, I haven’t seen many that are running Linux only on these machines yet, so there’s a bit of the unknown to contend with, I have to rate this one as still being expensive.</p>\n<p>Then there are the specialty Linux makers, they’ve sold Linux pre-installed on systems for years,<img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/pangolin-small.jpg\" alt=\"System76 Pangolin\"> mostly outside of the US, but still, they’re someone I wanted to target for a long time. Looking at a system over at System76, I found a comparable model with Ubuntu Linux preloaded, <a href=\"http://system76.com/product_info.php?cPath=28&amp;products_id=50\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\"><strong>System76 Pangolin Value</strong></a><strong> running is $1051</strong>, a little better, and nice that Linux is pre-installed (even though I’d likely wipe it as soon as I got it). Next up, Emporer Linux had a model with a smaller harddrive, but otherwise almost lined up pre-installed with Ubuntu Linux, but the <a href=\"http://www.emperorlinux.com/systems/medium/tiger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\"><strong>Emporer’s Tiger model</strong></a><strong> would cost a whopping $1475</strong>. So thanks, but really, why would I consider a lessor spec’d system for more money?  I like that they’re selling systems with Linux, but not enought to spend that much more for the pleasure.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/hp.jpg\" alt=\"hp\">So now we move on to the big players, yep, companies like HP, IBM/Lenovo and Dell are selling pre-installed Linux desktops and notebooks to regular Joes like yourself, or so I thought. Over at HP is where I hit my first snag. I found a laptop that compared favorably to my specs, however you couldn’t get Linux, or the FreeDOS option (which basically means a computer without an OS installed, but with install disks for FreeOS) on that one. So while <a href=\"http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/en/WF25a/321957-321957-64295-321838-89315-3442832.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\"><strong>HP’s 6720s Notebook</strong></a><strong> sells for $799</strong> it includes the garish Windows Vista (a view I’d rather not experience). Still, I wouldn’t have to run it, I would still install Linux right off<img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/emperor.jpg\" alt=\"Emperor Tiger\"> the bat, as I would likely with any of the sytems I’d buy. Seeing how much of a machine I could get for the money when looking at ‘Windows’ systems made the likelyhood of a pre-installed Linux laptop less likely. Undeterred, I pressed on. IBM/Lenovo’s Thinkpad series has been a long running favorite among freaks who want to run Linux on a laptop, and I found a sweet one,  <a href=\"http://shop.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/e/web/LenovoPortal/en_US/catalog.workflow:category.details?current-catalog-id=12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087¤t-category-id=5D3D13908B314242BD226E9BF4C1A1DB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\"><strong>IBM’s Thinkpad R61</strong></a><strong> for $922</strong> measured up nicely, but again, same disclaimer about Windows, which is annoying when you don’t really know how much more you’re paying to have the ability to choose better systems.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/131.jpg\" alt=\"Inspiron\">Then there’s Dell, perhaps the noisest, new retailer that pre-isntalls Linux.  If you’re on dell.com, from the Desktop or Notebook drop down menus on most of the pages (Even the ‘Home’ section) you can find a link for Open-Source PCs. Now while that doesn’t say ‘Linux’ (and I suspect most wouldn’t equate that with Linux) it’s a start. Going straight to <a href=\"http://dell.com/open\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Dell’s Open Source/Ubuntu </a>page gets you there quicker, where you can spec out the Ubuntu Linux pre-installed <a href=\"http://configure.us.dell.com/dellstore/config.aspx?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;kc=6V440&amp;l=en&amp;oc=DNCWJL1&amp;s=dhs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\"><strong>Inspiron 1420N</strong></a><strong> going for $939</strong>. Not bad, the only thing is, that’s the only choice you have as far as Laptops with Linux preinstalled in the Dell world.</p>\n<p>So, knowing how cheap the laptops from Dell get, due to their incessant catalogs about their Small<img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/vostro.jpg\" alt=\"Vostro 1500\"> Business deals I keep finding in my mailbox, I start poking around the site. The catalog showed some attractive prices on the new base Vostro model, the 1000. I found that a one could be had for $449, but that left you with a bunch of upgrades to get it up to something more comparable to the above. Once that is done you’re looking at the <a href=\"http://configure.us.dell.com/dellstore/config.aspx?c=us&amp;cs=04&amp;kc=6W300&amp;l=en&amp;oc=bqcwixh&amp;s=bsd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\"><strong>Dell Vostro 1000</strong></a><strong> for $609</strong>.  Wow, that’s not bad - of course it gives you the older Athlon 64 X2 Dual-Core, and I’m personally a little wary of putting such a beast in a laptop. Still, the other components are decent, not the best, but passable. The ATI video used shared memory, something you want to steer away from, but again, for most, this would be fine and the 15.4” widescreen wouldn’t be bad to have at all.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/vostro.jpg\" alt=\"Vostro 1500\">Then I took at look at the Vostro 1500, still the 15.4” screen, but available with the lower power (compared to other new dual-core systems) Intel® Core™ 2 Duo T5470 (1.6GHz, 2MB L2 Cache, 800MHz FSB).  The thing I like about this is that while it’s a dual-core, it’s not excessive (the MacBooks we started looking at were 2.0Ghz Duo chips), and it fits in well with my wanting to use the tools and ideas put forth by Intel on their new site, <a href=\"http://lesswatts.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Less Watts</a>.  On the site they document how you can get the most of the battery life on Intel based systems running Linux. They even have a new app, PowerTop that acts like the old Unix utility Top, but instead or apps it lists the devices in your machine by power usage.  So while this may have been a clever PR move, it worked for me because I can see that I will be able to get the most of an Intel laptop with Linux, far an away over what I could do if I were running Mac or Windows. So, with the Vostro 1500 in my sights I started more targeted research. After some nice reviews I found that <a href=\"http://dealspl.us/Dell-Vostro-1500-Intel-Core-2-Duo-1-6GHz-2GB-80GB-15-4-Widescreen-Laptop_65646\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">a link from one of those deal sites</a> showing that the <strong><a href=\"http://www.dell.com/content/default.aspx?c=us&amp;cs=04&amp;l=en&amp;s=bsd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Dell Vostro 1500</a> could be had for $599</strong>.  Well that was that, for the specs I listed above:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Intel Core 2 Duo T5470, 1.6GHz, 800Mhz FSB, 2M L2 Cache<br>15.4 inch Wide Screen XGA LCD display<br>1GB, DDR2, 667MHz 2 DIMM<br>128MB NVIDIA GeForce 8400M GS<br>120G 5400RPM SATA Hard Drive<br>Integrated 10/100 Network Cardand Modem<br>8X DVD+/-RW with double-layer DVD+R write capability<br>Integrated High Definition Audio 2.0<br>Intel 3945 WLAN (802.11a/g) Mini Card<br>Integrated 2.0 mega pixel webcam<br>Integrated Bluetooth<br>85 WHr 9-cell Lithium Ion Primary Battery</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So I bought the Dell Vostro 1500 for $629 (the only thing I added was the webcam), that was far and away much more computer for the money than I had seen anywhere else.  The new Vostro line is of course Dell’s ‘basic’ line, but what does that mean?  It means it’s not as flashy, thin or light as the Inspirons, and that’s OK, I just want a laptop that is going to have a good screen, and be able to be jostled around while I check my email, play toons and adminstrate my servers.  This fits the bill, and while its looks may only say “Hey, I’m a laptop” it just leaves me to imagine it covered with stickers.  Now if you follow my original link you’ll just be redirected to a basic landing page at Dell, but if you follow another <a href=\"http://configure.us.dell.com/dellstore/config.aspx?c=us&amp;cs=04&amp;kc=6W300&amp;l=en&amp;oc=bqdwk7x&amp;s=bsd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">link from those deal sites</a>, you’ll find the price is now $679, but if you just go to Dell.com and configure a 1500 the same way it will come to about $778.  Regardless, more deal-site surfing should reveal a better deal by now.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Here I site with a nice, new, fast laptop running Ubuntu Linux, 7.10 (Gusty) Beta and it’s awesome. Install was normal, I ran it from the desktop LiveCD so I could use the desktop while it was installing, everything worked there, after the install and I rebooted, graphics were good, wireless came up automagically, and after I set some desktop settings it prompted me to auto-install the fast nVidia drivers. After restarting the desktop session all of the Compiz eye-candy was working! Nice. Had issue with the sound, quickly solved after searching the great Ubuntu forums, same thing with suspend, it’s working great now too. Last night I checked my email, downloaded the new Radiohead release, used Ubuntu’s Add/Remove feature to enable mp3 usage, played the mp3s in Rhythmbox, burned the mp3s to cd (cdrw ‘just worked’), plugged in my iPod, it showed up under Rhythmbox, dragged the new Radiohead to it, that ‘just worked’ too. A little round button with a home icon is next to the power button, I didn’t expect it to work and was going to bind it to something, but clicking it brings up Rhythmbox (notice a pattern of what I use computers for?) and then hitting the media buttons in the front of the laptop started the songs playing; so those all ‘just worked’. Later I pulled up my resume on Google Docs, then opened it as an Open Office document, and yeah, that ‘just worked’ too. At first I was hesitant to get the 15.4” screen over the 1400’s 14” one, but I’m glad I did. The screen is big, but not unruly so like the 17” ones I’ve seen, and I actually really like the TrueLife (read glossy, very glossy) screen. They say it gives better brightness and contrast, and it must because things look hella sharp. I run the fabulous conky for feedback on my system stats, we’re seeing it running in the low 40s range for Celsius, and I’m monitoring both cores on the CPU. Since Ubuntu runs the powernowd daemon to scale up/down by default, they’re almost always both running at 800Mhz. It’s fun to watch one of them jump up to 1.6Ghz when needed, sometimes joined by the other, and then drop back to idle a split second later. I will be looking more into how much lower they can drop (the old laptop was a single 800Mhz and would drop to 400Mhz) and have already installed Intel’s Powertop app that I mentioned above, so watch for more posts on battery saving. I feel pretty good about that since I can make the ‘top run cooler, and sip from the extra large 9-cell battery.</p>\n<p>So, I have a new laptop, it’s running the latest version of my favorite desktop Linux beautifully; I couldn’t be happier. I’m still stoked about the price too - take a look, you might be able to do better! If anyone has issues with the 1500, leave me a note below, or hit the Ubuntu Forums, it seems everything can be easily solved.</p>\n<p>Finally, I found a topical New York Times article about Linux as a desktop option titled <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/04/technology/circuits/04basics.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">The Next Leap for Linux</a>, that includes a perfect image for the end of this story, a Vostro with Linux in front of XP and Mac laptops.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/leap.jpg\" alt=\"Linux on a Vostro FTW!\"></p>\n<p>Linux FTW!</p>\n","source":"_posts/buying-a-linux-laptop-in-2007.markdown","raw":"---\nauthor: phil\ncomments: true\ndate: 2007-10-10 13:14:21\nlayout: post\nslug: buying-a-linux-laptop-in-2007\ntitle: Buying a Linux laptop in 2007\nwordpress_id: 597\ncategories:\n- commerce\n- geek\n- linux\n- music\ntags:\n- apple\n- features\n- geek\n- howto\n- tech\n---\n\n![Stock laptop image](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/laptop.png)It's time for a new laptop, as I've detailed, I've ripped apart, [inserted coins and duct-taped ](http://fak3r.com/2007/05/29/howto-fix-a-g3-ibook-with-a-bad-logic-board-for-26-cents/) the old iBook back together again enough times, and it's no longer viable.

Last night I checked my email, downloaded the new Radiohead release, used Ubuntu's Add/Remove feature to enable mp3 usage, played the mp3s in Rhythmbox, burned the mp3s to cd (cdrw 'just worked'), plugged in my iPod, it showed up under Rhythmbox, dragged the new Radiohead to it, that 'just worked' too. A little round button with a home icon is next to the power button, I didn't expect it to work and was going to bind it to something, but clicking it brings up Rhythmbox (notice a pattern of what I use computers for?) and then hitting the media buttons in the front of the laptop started the songs playing; so those all 'just worked'. Later I pulled up my resume on Google Docs, then opened it as an Open Office document, and yeah, that 'just worked' too. At first I was hesitant to get the 15.4\" screen over the 1400's 14\" one, but I'm glad I did. The screen is big, but not unruly so like the 17\" ones I've seen, and I actually really like the TrueLife (read glossy, very glossy) screen. They say it gives better brightness and contrast, and it must because things look hella sharp. I run the fabulous conky for feedback on my system stats, we're seeing it running in the low 40s range for Celsius, and I'm monitoring both cores on the CPU. Since Ubuntu runs the powernowd daemon to scale up/down by default, they're almost always both running at 800Mhz. It's fun to watch one of them jump up to 1.6Ghz when needed, sometimes joined by the other, and then drop back to idle a split second later. I will be looking more into how much lower they can drop (the old laptop was a single 800Mhz and would drop to 400Mhz) and have already installed Intel's Powertop app that I mentioned above, so watch for more posts on battery saving. I feel pretty good about that since I can make the 'top run cooler, and sip from the extra large 9-cell battery.\n\nSo, I have a new laptop, it's running the latest version of my favorite desktop Linux beautifully; I couldn't be happier. I'm still stoked about the price too - take a look, you might be able to do better! If anyone has issues with the 1500, leave me a note below, or hit the Ubuntu Forums, it seems everything can be easily solved.\n\nFinally, I found a topical New York Times article about Linux as a desktop option titled [The Next Leap for Linux](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/04/technology/circuits/04basics.html), that includes a perfect image for the end of this story, a Vostro with Linux in front of XP and Mac laptops.\n\n\n![Linux on a Vostro FTW!](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/leap.jpg)\n\n\n\n\nLinux FTW!\n","updated":1414378977000,"excerpt":"<p><img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/laptop.png\" alt=\"Stock laptop image\">It’s time for a new laptop, as I’ve detailed, I’ve ripped apart, <a href=\"http://fak3r.com/2007/05/29/howto-fix-a-g3-ibook-with-a-bad-logic-board-for-26-cents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">inserted coins and duct-taped </a> the old iBook back together again enough times, and it’s no longer viable. It’ll work fine on a flat surface, but if you try to use it as a laptop the minor flexing must loosen the video chip, because you quickly find your video locked, with a hard reboot the only fix. The wildcards are me as a buyer, since I’m hardly ordinary with my expectation that any laptop or desktop I’m going to buy is only going to run Linux, and the recent announcements by HP, IBM/Lenovo and Dell about their Linux support (some even pre-installed), I knew I’d <strong>finally</strong> have choices to consider. In the end I came up with a pretty current system, that Debian or Ubuntu will be 100% compatible with, and will be proud to call home. The detailed specs:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Intel Core 2 Duo T5470, 1.6GHz, 800Mhz FSB, 2M L2 Cache<br>15.4 inch Wide Screen XGA LCD display<br>1GB, DDR2, 667MHz 2 DIMM<br>128MB NVIDIA GeForce 8400M GS<br>120G 5400RPM SATA Hard Drive<br>Integrated 10/100 Network Cardand Modem<br>8X DVD+/-RW with double-layer DVD+R write capability<br>Integrated High Definition Audio 2.0<br>Intel 3945 WLAN (802.11a/g) Mini Card<br>Integrated 2.0 mega pixel webcam<br>Integrated Bluetooth<br>85 WHr 9-cell Lithium Ion Primary Battery</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is more system that I originally spec’d out, but the price was right, so I’m very happy.  Before I reveal which brand I picked, I’ll tell the interesting story of how I ended up with the ‘top I did, and how things compare for laptop Linux options these days, it’s an interesting ride.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: feel free to <a href=\"http://digg.com/linux_unix/Buying_a_Linux_laptop_in_2007\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Digg this article</a> if you like it.</p>\n","_id":"62ibnpz5rz8bmzuu","photos":[],"link":""},{"author":"phil","comments":true,"date":1210961472000,"layout":"post","slug":"california-to-allow-same-sex-marriage","title":"California to allow same sex marriage","wordpress_id":788,"categories":["8poz6aqqtct4i4w3"],"content":"<p><img src=\"http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/hrc.gif\" alt=\"Human Rights Campaign\">Yesterday California Supreme Court <a href=\"http://www.hrc.org/10444.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">struck down the ban on gay marriage</a>, making it only the second state to allow/acknowledge same sex marriage.

So why should a local market worry about a corporation that doesn’t care about them?","_id":"j4d11suu5emqmtzh","photos":[],"link":""},{"author":"phil","comments":true,"date":1184862765000,"layout":"post","slug":"confessions-of-spammerx","title":"Confessions of SpammerX","wordpress_id":572,"categories":["gjhazm0jblc8rl5q"],"tags":["y4x2m41veknld344","58wtfkp6chlc3k5k","lqigt6wnac189x0u"],"content":"<p>A former spammer <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/pcworld/20070718/tc_pcworld/134721\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">comes forth to tell his story</a>, an amazing look at how easy something like this is to get away with.  “<em>Ed,” a retired spammer, built a considerable fortune sending e-mails that promoted pills, porn and casinos.

On Tuesday they were the musical guest on <a href=\"http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Late Night With Jimmy Fallon</a> where they played the title track, and just tore things up. A lot of response I’ve read online has questioned, or poked fun at, Bradford Cox’s outfit and his walking off set near the end of the song, but who cares, it’s rock and roll, it’s great. As for the song, it far outdoes any thoughts I had of their future material, this is something else:</p>\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n\n<p>The site <a href=\"http://www.collegedj.net/2013/04/03/alternative/watch-deerhunter-performs-monomania-live-on-fallon-video/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">CollegeDJ</a> summed things up, <em>“Bradford Cox transformed himself into “Connie Lungpin” for the performance, donning a wig and bandaged fingers. “Monomania” is the title track from the band’s upcoming album, out May 7th”</em> Then at <a href=\"http://consequenceofsound.net/2013/04/deerhunter-debut-new-song-monomania-on-fallon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">COS</a> they describe the album as a, <em>“…the 12-track effort was recorded at Rare Book Room Studio in Brooklyn.

The important thing here is that companies are doing this not for the benefit of the user, but for the benefit of the shareholders of the company, and if they can do this now, they can do this later, or whenever suits them. Simply, a fair user policy today can change tomorrow. These changes to policies or features are designed to make user’s data, and their interaction with the site, more profitable for the company. Knowing this should signal an alarm for everyone to understand HOW their data is being stored and USED. We’ll look at recent developments this year that cause concern among privacy advocates, while poking fun at some of the silly ways these new measures are sold to the populace, then we’ll cover what can be done, to increase users’ privacy online with common sense and open source software.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>echo “o’hai!”; <code>whoami</code></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>I am a security researcher, open-source technologist, practicing trouble maker, DEF CON, SEMAFOR speaker</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"The_problem;_user’s_loss_of_online_privacy\">The problem; user’s loss of online privacy</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>How much should people worry about the loss of online privacy?</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>How much is a persons’ privacy worth?

It's with this idea that I move forward with my propsal for this year, so I dreamt up a title page and got cracking; the working title is 0nline Privacy In The Year of The Dragon.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n[![0nline Privacy In The Year of The Dragon](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/12/files/dc_title.png)](http://fak3r.com/2012/03/27/def-con-20-cfp/dc_title/)\n\n\n### Title\n\n\n\n\n0nline Privacy In The Year of The Dragon\n\n\n\n\n\n## Abstract\n\n\n\n\nUser’s privacy online is constantly changing, witness Google’s March 1st consolidation of their privacy polices, the ever changing Facebook privacy policies or how commerce determine the ways policy changes for other entities - then note the lack of any opt-out when these changes occur. The important thing here is that companies are doing this not for the benefit of the user, but for the benefit of the shareholders of the company, and if they can do this now, they can do this later, or whenever suits them. Simply, a fair user policy today can change tomorrow. These changes to policies or features are designed to make user’s data, and their interaction with the site, more profitable for the company. Knowing this should signal an alarm for everyone to understand HOW their data is being stored and USED. We'll look at recent developments this year that cause concern among privacy advocates, while poking fun at some of the silly ways these new measures are sold to the populace, then we'll cover what can be done, to increase users' privacy online with common sense and open source software.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n  * echo \"o'hai!\"; `whoami`\n\n\t\n  * I am a security researcher, open-source technologist, practicing trouble maker, DEF CON, SEMAFOR speaker\n\n\n\n\n### The problem; user's loss of online privacy\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n  * How much should people worry about the loss of online privacy?\n\n\t\n  * How much is a persons' privacy worth? Google, what do you think? (this one is good)\n\n\t\n  * What are our online identities, who determines how they are presented/evolved -- \"But these same trends raise questions about another topic that gets far less attention: our online identity. It's in this vital but less heralded area where Kaliya Hamlin, 35, aka \"Identity Woman,\" has become one of the most influential voices in Silicon Valley.\" http://www.mercurynews.com/chris-obrien/ci_20116258/obrien-kaliya-identity-woman-hamlin-hopes-international-recognition\n\n\t\n  * conclusion… If you're not paying for the product, you are the product. (so much for FREE email.. ;))\n\n\n\n\n### Social Networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n  * Study Reveals What Social Networks May Know About Non-Members\n\n\t\n  * scary stuff shows how who you know, even if you're not \"linked in\" to them, determine much about you and your preferences http://www.sci-news.com/othersciences/mathematics/article00289.html\n\n\t\n  * The bizarre but true story of people in interviews for jobs being asked their Facebook passwords (unreal!)\n\n\t\n  * Changes in policy have the Feds calling: Facebook and Google have made damaging errors in the minefield of personal information, privacy and business. Both have been sued for their use of customers’ data and have entered into agreements with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to change their practices http://www.business2community.com/tech-gadgets/time-for-a-privacy-policy-review-0142479\n\n\t\n  * Privacy tussle brews over social media monitoring -- The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and other agencies contend that social media monitoring is a vital part of their efforts to keep abreast of events that that could pose threats to national security and public safety. Privacy advocates maintain that unfettered social media monitoring by the government will chill free speech and intrude upon privacy and civil rights. The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and other groups have noted that that at least some of the information harvested from social media sites by some government agencies has little to do with public safety goals. https://www.networkworld.com/news/2012/021612-privacy-tussle-brews-over-social-256260.html?hpg1=bn\n\n\n\n\n#### Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n  * \"By the end of the summer, it may have **more than a billion users, or about fifteen per cent of the world’s population**. Some of these people are restive and see Facebook as a substitute public space for speech and dissent that their own authoritarian regimes don’t provide. Facebook users have already helped to foment revolution in some places (Egypt and Tunisia) and are still trying, at great cost, to overthrow one of the Middle East’s most brutal regimes.\" http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2012/05/leaving-facebookistan.html#ixzz1w853THm6\n\n\t\n  * 75%+ of users are non-US (this surprised me)\n\n\t\n  * \"Facebook may be forced to make changes to its data use policy after campaigners helped drive enough complaints about the company's own proposed amendments to trigger a user vote on the matter. http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/05/25/facebook_data_use_policy_up_for_vote/\n\n\t\n  * Clayton High's principal resigns amid Facebook mystery http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/clayton-high-s-principal-resigns-amid-facebook-mystery/article_70bd065a-5912-551a-ac73-746ea58177af.html#.T6bbDpFbq2V.facebook\n\n\t\n  * Facebook changes privacy policy, implements timeline (with no OPT-OUT, short of deleting your account)\n\n\n\n\n#### Google\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n  * In 1999, Scott McNealy, the former head of Sun MicroSystems, reportedly declared, \"You have zero privacy anyway....Get over it.\" He unintentionally let the proverbial cat out of the bag of the digital age. In 2009, McNealy’s assessment was confirmed by Google’s CEO, Eric Schmidt. In an interview with NBC's Mario Bartiromo, he proclaimed, \"If you have something that you don't want anyone to know maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.\" Schmidt’s words have become Google’s new mantra.

Because of this I’m finally getting to put my money where my mouth is.  For years I’ve talked about my ideas and theories about how I could network disparate systems together and have them leverage each other to keep everything in sync.  So, while working with Open Source to push boundaries I seem to find more ways to do more complex things.  One basic idea that I’m working on now is that data sets are huge, and are only going to get huger (and hugerer) as time goes on, how to handle this has been solved a few different ways.  Usually it’s someone like the <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/index.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Internet Archive</a> who have 1000s of computers networked together to share the data (they are using some parts of <a href=\"http://hadoop.apache.org/core/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">hadoop</a> for the distributed file system, and then <a href=\"http://lucene.apache.org/nutch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">nutch</a> for search indexing) - but it’s still working from one central point of failure.  I started doing research to find out how this has been solved before, and if my idea of building a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_(protocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">BitTorrent</a>) network was sound - and I found some great information to build on.  As I’m setting up my demo BitTorrent tracker in Debian, this info keeps me thinking of the best ways to implement my ideas.  Much of my progress is due to the very helpful advice of Paul at <a href=\"http://torrents.geograph.org.uk/index.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Geograph Torrent Archive</a>, a project that has somewhat similar goals.<a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p>First, a great first introduction of what bittorrent is, and what it accomplishes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“BitTorrent does not centrally manage resource allocation. Instead, each client attempts to maximise its download rate by controlling various protocol parameters. Clients make direct connections (using ports 6881-6889 by default) to one or more of the clients in the list, to exchange parts of the file. Direct connections between clients are duplex (bi-directional), and every client tries to maintain the greatest number of active connections. A client’s refusal to upload temporarily is known as choking. Connections are choked to prevent leeching a situation where another client is downloading, but not uploading.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To maximize the number of duplex connections, clients reward each other by reciprocating uploads. So clients unwilling to upload will find their download rate dropping as other clients choke in response. Clients decide which connections to choke or unchoke by calculating the current download rate of each connection, once every ten seconds. The connection is left choked or unchoked until the next ten-second period is up. This fixed interval cycle prevents clients from rapidly choking and unchoking, causing network resources to be wasted. Finally, a client does an “optimistic” unchoke, once every 30 seconds, to try out unused connections to determine if they might offer better transfer rates than current ones.” [<a href=\"http://www.technetra.com/writings/archive/2004/04/25/bittorrent-a-p2p-file-sharing-protocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">link</a>]</p>\n<p>Now on to comments by others in how to use/harness this system for data propogation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“One idea that does linger in my head is the idea of creating a bittorrent distribution channel for library cataloging data. In the podcast, a concern was raised on whether a single server such as Library of Congress’s might be serverely impacted if a lot of requests were made against its SRU server. If all the hopes of Casey Bisson’s gift to the library community are realized, what if libraries were to contribute their individual cataloging and authority records to a global torrent? Again, I don’t see the value of a single large file, like MIT’s Barton data, over distribution of individual records. In the real world, torrent sharing is mostly at the work-level and that would seem to be the logical way to handle library records.” [<a href=\"http://www.tomkeays.com/blog/archives/2006/12/18/004216.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">link</a>]</p>\n<p>“Institutional repositories - I don’t hear as much noise about institutional repositories as I used to hear. I think their lack of popularity is directly related to the problems they are designed to solve, namely, long-term access. Don’t get me wrong, long-term access is definitely a good thing, but that is a library value. In order to be compelling, institutional repositories need to solve the problems of depositors, not the librarians. What do authors get by putting their content in an institutional repository that they don’t get elsewhere? If they supported version control, collaboration, commenting, tagging, better syndication and possibilities for content reuse — in other words, services against the content — then institutional repositories might prove to be more popular.” [<a href=\"http://infomotions.com/blog/2008/06/top-tech-trends-for-ala-summer-08/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">link</a>]</p>\n<p>“Of particular interest here is how such a description of BitTorrent intersects on certain points (which I have emphasized above) with larger conversations and concerns campus IT organizations are currently having regarding the increasingly prohibitive costs of owning, maintaining, and monitoring data services locally. In fact, this an issue with much larger scope that is not limited to the education sector by any means. Much of this is a result of our particular moment wherein a plethora of externally hosted options provide college communities the same, if not better, services with infinitely more storage space. And all of this at a fraction of the cost. For some campus IT shops in the business of supporting themselves financially, or even making money, the risks of not going in such a direction are much more dire. The recent news that the University of Washington’s IT department will be laying off 15% of their staff speaks directly to this. In fact, a number of schools have already begun offloading IT staples such as file storage and email to externally hosted solutions. Arizona State University was one of the the first large universities to do this in a deal with Google back in the Fall of 2006, and it is a trend we will continue to see much more of in the coming months and years, particularly as budgets shrink and the economy continues to tank.” [<a href=\"http://bavatuesdays.com/bittorrent-an-educational-autopsy-of-the-hydra/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">link</a>]</p>\n<p>“[…] bioinformatics networks present unique networking challenges that typically can’t be addressed by generic network installations. The first is that there is a huge amount of data involved. The network isn’t handling short e-mail messages typical of the corporate environment, but massive sequence strings, images, and other data.

Instead, each client attempts to maximise its download rate by controlling various protocol parameters. Clients make direct connections (using ports 6881-6889 by default) to one or more of the clients in the list, to exchange parts of the file. Direct connections between clients are duplex (bi-directional), and every client tries to maintain the greatest number of active connections. A client's refusal to upload temporarily is known as choking. Connections are choked to prevent leeching a situation where another client is downloading, but not uploading.\n\nTo maximize the number of duplex connections, clients reward each other by reciprocating uploads. So clients unwilling to upload will find their download rate dropping as other clients choke in response. Clients decide which connections to choke or unchoke by calculating the current download rate of each connection, once every ten seconds. The connection is left choked or unchoked until the next ten-second period is up. This fixed interval cycle prevents clients from rapidly choking and unchoking, causing network resources to be wasted. Finally, a client does an \"optimistic\" unchoke, once every 30 seconds, to try out unused connections to determine if they might offer better transfer rates than current ones.\" [[link](http://www.technetra.com/writings/archive/2004/04/25/bittorrent-a-p2p-file-sharing-protocol)]\n\n\nNow on to comments by others in how to use/harness this system for data propogation:\n\n\n> \"One idea that does linger in my head is the idea of creating a bittorrent distribution channel for library cataloging data. In the podcast, a concern was raised on whether a single server such as Library of Congress's might be serverely impacted if a lot of requests were made against its SRU server. If all the hopes of Casey Bisson's gift to the library community are realized, what if libraries were to contribute their individual cataloging and authority records to a global torrent? Again, I don't see the value of a single large file, like MIT's Barton data, over distribution of individual records. In the real world, torrent sharing is mostly at the work-level and that would seem to be the logical way to handle library records.\" [[link](http://www.tomkeays.com/blog/archives/2006/12/18/004216.php)]\n\n\n\n\n> \"Institutional repositories - I don’t hear as much noise about institutional repositories as I used to hear. I think their lack of popularity is directly related to the problems they are designed to solve, namely, long-term access. Don’t get me wrong, long-term access is definitely a good thing, but that is a library value. In order to be compelling, institutional repositories need to solve the problems of depositors, not the librarians. What do authors get by putting their content in an institutional repository that they don’t get elsewhere? If they supported version control, collaboration, commenting, tagging, better syndication and possibilities for content reuse — in other words, services against the content — then institutional repositories might prove to be more popular.\" [[link](http://infomotions.com/blog/2008/06/top-tech-trends-for-ala-summer-08/)]\n\n\n\n\n> \"Of particular interest here is how such a description of BitTorrent intersects on certain points (which I have emphasized above) with larger conversations and concerns campus IT organizations are currently having regarding the increasingly prohibitive costs of owning, maintaining, and monitoring data services locally. In fact, this an issue with much larger scope that is not limited to the education sector by any means. Much of this is a result of our particular moment wherein a plethora of externally hosted options provide college communities the same, if not better, services with infinitely more storage space. And all of this at a fraction of the cost. For some campus IT shops in the business of supporting themselves financially, or even making money, the risks of not going in such a direction are much more dire. The recent news that the University of Washington’s IT department will be laying off 15% of their staff speaks directly to this. In fact, a number of schools have already begun offloading IT staples such as file storage and email to externally hosted solutions. Arizona State University was one of the the first large universities to do this in a deal with Google back in the Fall of 2006, and it is a trend we will continue to see much more of in the coming months and years, particularly as budgets shrink and the economy continues to tank.\" [[link](http://bavatuesdays.com/bittorrent-an-educational-autopsy-of-the-hydra/)]\n\n\n\n\n> \"[...] bioinformatics networks present unique networking challenges that typically can't be addressed by generic network installations. The first is that there is a huge amount of data involved. The network isn't handling short e-mail messages typical of the corporate environment, but massive sequence strings, images, and other data. In addition, unlike networks that support traditional business transaction processing, data are continually flowing from disk arrays, servers, and other sources to computers for processing because the data can't fit into computer RAM.

It is written by someone who spends every day building, configuring, and installing custom kernels as part of the development process of this fun, collaborative project called Linux. I'm especially proud of the chapter on how to figure out how to configure a custom kernel based on the hardware running on your machine.  This is an essential task for anyone wanting to wring out the best possible speed and control of your hardware._\" He goes on to say that the book is now free for download in order to give others the experience of compiling their own kernel to understand how easy it actually is to contribute to Linux.  A little code here and there, patched into the kernel, and submitted for inclusion.\n","updated":1414378977000,"excerpt":"","_id":"bekp87ne4jr3tmz2","tags":[],"photos":[],"link":""},{"author":"phil","comments":true,"date":1143258180000,"layout":"post","slug":"drum-machine","title":"Drum machine","wordpress_id":29,"categories":["cqw66jld2sx6kyso"],"content":"<p><img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/thom.jpg\" alt=\"thom.jpg\">I found a flash drum machine movie <a href=\"http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/drum.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">here</a>, it’s pretty cool.

Earlier this week they released version 2.0 with a host of improvements (many small) and some needed polish.  While the jump to 2.0 may have been a bit of a reach, the direction Firefox is heading is always interesting.  Of course being an open source project there’s always room for tweaking, and while I now take a much more conservative approach to it, I still think changing some things make it (much) better.  After a recent post on Digg I reworked a fresh copy of 2.0 to have minimal tweaks that don’t overwhelm or cause instability.  Here I’ll document my basic changes and welcome comments on them, or any others that users prefer.  (<a href=\"http://fak3r.com/2006/10/26/firefox-20-tweaks/#more-231\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Continue reading</a>)<a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>First, the only add-on or extension that I install is called <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1951/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Fission</a>. Fission allows you to combine the address bar and the progress bar, allowing for the Safari feel of page loading, which is something I think Apple did very well.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/fission-1.jpg\" alt=\"fission-1.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Another of its options (and one that I now use) is to also allow the ‘Status bar’ messages to appear in the Address bar, this way when a page is loading, or when your cursor hovers over a link, the URL appears in the Address bar.  Now you can click ‘View -&gt; Status bar’ and turn it off, giving you a tad more real estate, but also making the browser that much cleaner.  Hard to explain, but really nice in my mind.  Check out Fission’s preferences for a guide.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Side note: if you’re running Firefox on Apple and you don’t like the fact that Firefox may not blend in with the OS X look as much as you’d like, checkout the themes over at <a href=\"http://takebacktheweb.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">GrApple</a>.  Their themes are <em>very</em> nice, and you can see a bit of one of them in action in the above screen shot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now come a few configuration tweaks to solve a few annoyances.  First comes turning off the amazingly annoying tool tips.  This is especially an issue when you have a URL you want to add to the toolbar, you go to drag it, but the cursor sees another link below it, and you get the big yellow box with the link title and description.  Plus, I already know how to use Firefox, and I can read my links, so I don’t need boxes telling me what I already know.  Unfortunately it’s not an option you can turn off in the Preferences, you have to modify the configuration by hand.  Luckily Mozilla developers have made this easy, with almost a GUI front end to ensure you don’t screw things up too badly.  So, to make this change, in the address bar enter:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>about:config</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>…and press Enter.  Now you’ll see a long list of options, and also a search field just below the address bar.  In this search field, cut/paste in:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>browser.chrome.toolbar_tips</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once it comes up, right click on it, and choose ‘Toggle’, which will change its value from True to False, thus turning it off.</p>\n<p>The next option, more of a performance/privacy option.  In order to speed up page loading Firefox will try and load links on you current page in the background based (somehow) on what it thinks are the most popular links on the page.  Dunno how it knows this, if it ‘phones home’ or what, but it’s not needed in these days of 1 Meg broadband everywhere.  Turn it off by searching for:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>network.prefetch-next</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again, right click on it, and choose ‘Toggle’, which will change its value from True to False, and turn it off.</p>\n<p>Once you start using tabs you can’t stop, and I find myself always having a ton of them open.  In 2.0 it nicely adds more by scrolling them off to the side and providing a new arrow button to show you that you have ones offscreen to view, and provide you a means of scrolling to them.  Very nice, but for my tastes it tends to start scolling things earlier than I’d like, and I end up having to really scroll around to do my work.  This tweak simply makes it so you’ll have more visable before the scrolling kicks in.  Search for:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>browser.tabs.tabMinWidth</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Right click and choose ‘Modify’  Set it to 75 and see if that suits your taste, or 0 to disable scroll completely (the default is 100)</p>\n<p>Lastly everyone always complains about how much memory Firefox eats up, but I suspect this is just a matter of people like me opening 100 tabs at once, but whatever.  This tweak cuts down on the browser cache, effectively making Firefox a better neighbor to your other RAM hungry apps.  To change it, search for:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>browser.cache.disk.capacity</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then right click and choose ‘Modify”.   The new value you use depends on your system’s total memory. According to Computerworld: For RAM sizes between 512BM and 1GB, start with 15000. For RAM sizes between 128MB and 512M, try 5000.</p>\n<p>Lastly, to take away some of the extra clutter for more real estate, update some chrome.  Firefox is very configurable, but there are things that aren’t handled via the ‘customized’ menu.  Cut/paste this text into userChrome.css (located in your Mozilla Application Data folder, or ~/.mozilla/profiles/[randomchars].default/chrome) to make the changes listed (ie- removing the ‘Go’ button, removing the ‘throbber’, etc)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>`/*</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Edit this file and copy it as userChrome.css into your</li>\n<li>profile-directory/chrome/<br><em>/`/</em></li>\n<li>This file can be used to customize the look of Mozilla’s user interface</li>\n<li>You should consider using !important on rules which you want to</li>\n<li>override default settings.<br>*/</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>/*</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not remove the @namespace line — it’s required for correct functioning<br><em>/<br>@namespace url(“<a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul</a>“); /</em> set default namespace to XUL */</li>\n</ul>\n<p>/*</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some possible accessibility enhancements:<br><em>/<br>/</em></li>\n<li>Make all the default font sizes 20 pt:<br>*</li>\n<li><ul>\n<li>{</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>font-size: 20pt !important</li>\n<li>}<br><em>/<br>/</em></li>\n<li>Make menu items in particular 15 pt instead of the default size:<br>*</li>\n<li>menupopup &gt; * {</li>\n<li>font-size: 15pt !important</li>\n<li>}<br><em>/<br>/</em></li>\n<li>Give the Location (URL) Bar a fixed-width font<br>*</li>\n<li><h1 id=\"urlbar_{\">urlbar {</h1>\n</li>\n<li>font-family: monospace !important;</li>\n<li>}<br>*/</li>\n</ul>\n<p>/*</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eliminate the throbber and its annoying movement:<br>*</li>\n<li><h1 id=\"throbber-box_{\">throbber-box {</h1>\n</li>\n<li>display: none !important;</li>\n<li>}<br>*/</li>\n</ul>\n<p>/*</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For more examples see <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/unix/customizing.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://www.mozilla.org/unix/customizing.html</a><br><em>/<br>/</em> Remove the Edit and Help menus<br>Id’s for all toplevel menus:<br>file-menu, edit-menu, view-menu, go-menu, bookmarks-menu, tools-menu, helpMenu */<h1 id=\"helpMenu,_#edit-menu_{_display:_none_!important;_}\">helpMenu, #edit-menu {    display: none !important; }</h1>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>/<em> Remove Home button </em>/</p>\n<h1 id=\"home-button_{_display:_none;_}\">home-button { display: none; }</h1>\n<h1 id=\"go-button-stack,_-search-go-button-stack_{\">go-button-stack, .search-go-button-stack {</h1>\n<p>display: none !important;<br>}</p>\n<p>/<em> Eliminate the throbber and its annoying movement: </em>/</p>\n<h1 id=\"throbber-box_{_display:_;_}\">throbber-box { display: ; }</h1>\n","source":"_posts/firefox-20-tweaks.markdown","raw":"---\nauthor: phil\ncomments: true\ndate: 2006-10-26 11:29:18\nlayout: post\nslug: firefox-20-tweaks\ntitle: Firefox 2.0 tweaks\nwordpress_id: 231\ncategories:\n- geek\ntags:\n- code\n---\n\n![firefox-logo.jpg](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/firefox-logo.jpg)By now you should know that if you surf the web, you should be using [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/).

Fission allows you to combine the address bar and the progress bar, allowing for the Safari feel of page loading, which is something I think Apple did very well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![fission-1.jpg](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/fission-1.jpg)\n\n\nAnother of its options (and one that I now use) is to also allow the 'Status bar' messages to appear in the Address bar, this way when a page is loading, or when your cursor hovers over a link, the URL appears in the Address bar.  Now you can click 'View -> Status bar' and turn it off, giving you a tad more real estate, but also making the browser that much cleaner.  Hard to explain, but really nice in my mind.  Check out Fission's preferences for a guide.\n\n\n> Side note: if you're running Firefox on Apple and you don't like the fact that Firefox may not blend in with the OS X look as much as you'd like, checkout the themes over at [GrApple](http://takebacktheweb.org/).  Their themes are *very* nice, and you can see a bit of one of them in action in the above screen shot.\n\n\nNow come a few configuration tweaks to solve a few annoyances.  First comes turning off the amazingly annoying tool tips.  This is especially an issue when you have a URL you want to add to the toolbar, you go to drag it, but the cursor sees another link below it, and you get the big yellow box with the link title and description.  Plus, I already know how to use Firefox, and I can read my links, so I don't need boxes telling me what I already know.  Unfortunately it's not an option you can turn off in the Preferences, you have to modify the configuration by hand.  Luckily Mozilla developers have made this easy, with almost a GUI front end to ensure you don't screw things up too badly.  So, to make this change, in the address bar enter:\n\n\n> `about:config`\n\n\n...and press Enter.  Now you'll see a long list of options, and also a search field just below the address bar.  In this search field, cut/paste in:\n\n\n> `browser.chrome.toolbar_tips`\n\n\nOnce it comes up, right click on it, and choose 'Toggle', which will change its value from True to False, thus turning it off.\n\nThe next option, more of a performance/privacy option.  In order to speed up page loading Firefox will try and load links on you current page in the background based (somehow) on what it thinks are the most popular links on the page.  Dunno how it knows this, if it 'phones home' or what, but it's not needed in these days of 1 Meg broadband everywhere.  Turn it off by searching for:\n\n\n> `network.prefetch-next`\n\n\nAgain, right click on it, and choose 'Toggle', which will change its value from True to False, and turn it off.\n\nOnce you start using tabs you can't stop, and I find myself always having a ton of them open.  In 2.0 it nicely adds more by scrolling them off to the side and providing a new arrow button to show you that you have ones offscreen to view, and provide you a means of scrolling to them.  Very nice, but for my tastes it tends to start scolling things earlier than I'd like, and I end up having to really scroll around to do my work.  This tweak simply makes it so you'll have more visable before the scrolling kicks in.  Search for:\n\n\n> `browser.tabs.tabMinWidth`\n\n\nRight click and choose 'Modify'  Set it to 75 and see if that suits your taste, or 0 to disable scroll completely (the default is 100)\n\nLastly everyone always complains about how much memory Firefox eats up, but I suspect this is just a matter of people like me opening 100 tabs at once, but whatever.  This tweak cuts down on the browser cache, effectively making Firefox a better neighbor to your other RAM hungry apps.  To change it, search for:\n\n\n> `browser.cache.disk.capacity`\n\n\nThen right click and choose 'Modify\".   The new value you use depends on your system's total memory. According to Computerworld: For RAM sizes between 512BM and 1GB, start with 15000. For RAM sizes between 128MB and 512M, try 5000.\n\nLastly, to take away some of the extra clutter for more real estate, update some chrome.  Firefox is very configurable, but there are things that aren't handled via the 'customized' menu.  Cut/paste this text into userChrome.css (located in your Mozilla Application Data folder, or ~/.mozilla/profiles/[randomchars].default/chrome) to make the changes listed (ie- removing the 'Go' button, removing the 'throbber', etc)\n\n\n> `/*\n* Edit this file and copy it as userChrome.css into your\n* profile-directory/chrome/\n*/`/*\n* This file can be used to customize the look of Mozilla's user interface\n* You should consider using !important on rules which you want to\n* override default settings.\n*/\n\n/*\n* Do not remove the @namespace line -- it's required for correct functioning\n*/\n@namespace url(\"http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul\"); /* set default namespace to XUL */\n\n/*\n* Some possible accessibility enhancements:\n*/\n/*\n* Make all the default font sizes 20 pt:\n*\n* * {\n*   font-size: 20pt !important\n* }\n*/\n/*\n* Make menu items in particular 15 pt instead of the default size:\n*\n* menupopup > * {\n*   font-size: 15pt !important\n* }\n*/\n/*\n* Give the Location (URL) Bar a fixed-width font\n*\n* #urlbar {\n*    font-family: monospace !important;\n* }\n*/\n\n/*\n* Eliminate the throbber and its annoying movement:\n*\n* #throbber-box {\n*   display: none !important;\n* }\n*/\n\n/*\n* For more examples see http://www.mozilla.org/unix/customizing.html\n*/\n/* Remove the Edit and Help menus\nId's for all toplevel menus:\nfile-menu, edit-menu, view-menu, go-menu, bookmarks-menu, tools-menu, helpMenu */\n#helpMenu, #edit-menu {    display: none !important; }\n\n/* Remove Home button */\n#home-button { display: none; }\n\n#go-button-stack, .search-go-button-stack {\ndisplay: none !important;\n}\n\n/* Eliminate the throbber and its annoying movement: */\n#throbber-box { display: ; }\n","updated":1414378977000,"excerpt":"<p><img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/firefox-logo.jpg\" alt=\"firefox-logo.jpg\">By now you should know that if you surf the web, you should be using <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Firefox</a>.  Earlier this week they released version 2.0 with a host of improvements (many small) and some needed polish.  While the jump to 2.0 may have been a bit of a reach, the direction Firefox is heading is always interesting.  Of course being an open source project there’s always room for tweaking, and while I now take a much more conservative approach to it, I still think changing some things make it (much) better.  After a recent post on Digg I reworked a fresh copy of 2.0 to have minimal tweaks that don’t overwhelm or cause instability.  Here I’ll document my basic changes and welcome comments on them, or any others that users prefer.

It’s based around a slightly older version of Ubuntu Linux so there may be some minor differences with newer releases, but you can always download the latest version from www.ubuntu.com or get a CD sent by post at shipit.ubuntu.com.\n\n\n> [The Linux Starter Pack](http://tuxradar.com/files/linux_starter_pack.zip) (PDF) 11.5MB\n\n\n\n\n### The Easiest Linux Guide You’ll Ever Read\n\n\n_by Scott Morris_\nAfter several months of writing and revising, Scott has made available the “Easiest Linux Guide You’ll Ever Read”. It is a 160-page book geared towards people who are competent with using Windows, who have never attempted to use Linux but are interested in giving it a try. This ebook seems to be around for quite some time, so I wouldn’t be surprised if a lot of you have already went through this copy. For a more thorough review of this ebook, click here, or click on the link below to grab it.\n\n\n> [The Easiest Linux Guide You’ll Ever Read](http://www.letslearnlinux.com/suseblog/easiest_linux_guide_ever.pdf) (PDF) 5.66MB\n\n\n\n\n### SUSE Linux Administration Guide\n\n\n_Too many authors to be listed here_\nThe SUSE LINUX Administration Guide provides background information about the way your SUSE LINUX operates. This book introduces Linux system administration basics such as file systems, kernels, boot processes, an Apache web server, and secure authentication.\n\n\n> [SUSE Linux Administration Guide](http://www.novell.com/documentation/suse91/suselinux-adminguide/html) (HTML)\n\n\n\n\n### Ubuntu: Pocket Guide and Reference\n\n\n**A concise companion for day-to-day Ubuntu use**\n_by Keir Thomas_\nA comprehensive, 170 page ebook which will get you started with Ubuntu. I believe a lot of computer users have intentions of getting a Linux system up just to test and experience the power behind this free operating system. There are various types of Linux, but so far, and at least for me, Ubuntu seems the most popular so far. I’m no means an experienced user of Ubuntu, so I can’t really speak on why it’s popular, but I think the simplicity, compatibility and user friendliness should do the trick. Some of the chapters in this ebook include:-\n\n\n\n\t\n  * Introduction\n\n\t\n  * Chapter One: Installing Ubuntu\n\n\t\n  * Chapter Two: Configuring Ubuntu\n\n\t\n  * Chapter Three: Getting to grips with the desktop\n\n\t\n  * Chapter Four: Users and the filesystem\n\n\t\n  * Chapter Five: Hands-on at the command-line\n\n\t\n  * Chapter Six: Software management\n\n\t\n  * Chapter Seven: Securing the system\n\n\n\n\n> [Ubuntu: Pocket Guide and Reference](http://www.ubuntupocketguide.com/download.html) (PDF) 2MB\n","updated":1414378977000,"excerpt":"<p><img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/tux.jpg\" alt=\"tux.jpg\">While looking for something else, (which is mainly when I find <em>other</em> interesting things) I found an article which included links for four free Linux eBooks.

Everyone knows about the man and his incredible words of wisdom, here I print a list I found online once entitled <em>10 fundamentals for changing the world</em>, with accompanying quotes from him on the topics.  Read through them and think about how they could be used to improve current situations; from your own, to our countries’, to the world.  We can do better and treat others better for the benefit of all, here are some ways.</p>\n<p><strong> 1. Change yourself. </strong><br><em> “You must be the change you want to see in the world.” </em></p>\n<p><strong> 2. You are in control. </strong><br><em>“Nobody can hurt me without my permission.”</em></p>\n<p><strong> 3. Forgive and let it go.</strong><br><em> “The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.” </em><br><em> “An eye for eye only ends up making the whole world blind.” </em></p>\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n\n<p><strong> 4. Without action you aren’t going anywhere. </strong><br><em> “An ounce of practice is worth more than tons of preaching.” </em></p>\n<p><strong> 5. Take care of this moment. </strong><br><em> “I do not want to foresee the future. I am concerned with taking care of the present. God has given me no control over the moment following.” </em></p>\n<p><strong> 6. Everyone is human. </strong><br><em> “I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps.” </em><br><em> “It is unwise to be too sure of one’s own wisdom. It is healthy to be reminded that the strongest might weaken and the wisest might err.” </em></p>\n<p><strong> 7. Persist. </strong><br><em> “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.” </em></p>\n<p><strong> 8. See the good in people and help them. </strong><br><em> “I look only to the good qualities of men. Not being faultless myself, I won’t presume to probe into the faults of others.” </em><br><em> “Man becomes great exactly in the degree in which he works for the welfare of his fellow-men.” </em><br><em> “I suppose leadership at one time meant muscles; but today it means getting along with people.” </em></p>\n<p><strong> 9. Be congruent, be authentic, be your true self. </strong><br><em> “Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.” </em><br><em> “Always aim at complete harmony of thought and word and deed.

I am concerned with taking care of the present. God has given me no control over the moment following.” _\n\n** 6. Everyone is human. **\n_ “I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps.” _\n_ “It is unwise to be too sure of one’s own wisdom. It is healthy to be reminded that the strongest might weaken and the wisest might err.” _\n\n** 7. Persist. **\n_ “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.” _\n\n** 8. See the good in people and help them. **\n_ “I look only to the good qualities of men. Not being faultless myself, I won’t presume to probe into the faults of others.” _\n_ “Man becomes great exactly in the degree in which he works for the welfare of his fellow-men.” _\n_ “I suppose leadership at one time meant muscles; but today it means getting along with people.” _\n\n** 9. Be congruent, be authentic, be your true self. **\n_ “Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.” _\n_ “Always aim at complete harmony of thought and word and deed.

But after running through many other iterations of GbV, Bob Pollard (the heart of GbV) pulled the plug on the band in 2004. Fast forward to last year, Bob got the ‘classic’ lineup back together for a handful of shows, which turned into a 1 year victory lap around the country.<a id=\"more\"></a> I saw one of the early gigs in Austin, and they did not disappoint; the magic was still there.

It’s so true, the autonomy gives authors a “right to speed” as it were.  People think they’re entitled to say what they want, without thought of reprisal, since they’re behind a veil of ones and zeros.

At least a dozen readers e-mailed me to inform me that the jingle is actually four notes, not five. As I’ve come to expect, some of these readers expressed, ahem, somewhat more anger than the circumstances might have seemed to require. “If you have that much trouble counting on one hand,” one wrote, “you shouldn’t be reviewing technology. Maybe a four-year-old can help you out next time.”</em></p>\n<p><em>I replied to this reader that I’m including the first “ping” in my tally. In that case, there ARE five notes in the jingle, as you can hear <a href=\"http://www.whitwell.ndo.co.uk/musicthing/sounds/intel.mp3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">here</a>. But my correspondent never wrote back. That, of course, would violate the rules for being an Internet pill, reprinted here in their entirety, courtesy of the Pills of the American Internet Neighborhood Society (PAINS): RULES FOR TROLLS AND PILLS</em></p>\n<p><strong>RULES FOR TROLLS AND PILLS</strong></p>\n<p>WHEREAS, 95 percent of all the e-mail received by critics and columnists is civil, friendly or respectfully constructive;</p>\n<p>but WHEREAS, this is the Internet age, and we’re all anonymous and can avoid making eye contact forever;</p>\n<p>and WHEREAS, there’s so much information overload, a little heat and drama on your part may be necessary just to be heard above the din;</p>\n<p>and WHEREAS, many of those who fire off potshots are missing out on some of the best techniques for effective snippiness;</p>\n<p>THEREFORE let us now post the rules for membership in the Pills of the American Internet Neighborhood Society.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Use the strongest language possible. Calling names is always effective, and four-letter words show that you mean business.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Having a violent opinion of something doesn’t require you to actually try it yourself. After all, plenty of people heatedly object to books they haven’t read or movies they haven’t seen. Heck, you can imagine perfectly well if something is any good.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If it’s a positive review that you didn’t like, call the reviewer a “fanboy.” Do not entertain the notion that the product, service, show, movie, book or restaurant might, in fact, be good. Instead, assume that the reviewer has received payment from the reviewee. Work in the word “shill” if possible.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If it’s a negative review, call the reviewer a “basher” and describe the review as a “hatchet job.” Accuse him of being paid off by the reviewee’s <em>rival</em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If it’s a mixed review, ignore the passages that balance the argument. Pretend that the entire review is all positive or all negative. Refer to it either as a “rave” or a “slam.”</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If you find a sentence early in the article that rubs you the wrong way, you are by no means obligated to finish reading. Stop right where you are–express your anger while it’s still good and hot! What are the odds that the writer is going to say anything else relevant to your point later in the piece, anyway?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If the writer responds to your e-mail with evidence that you’re wrong (for example, by citing a paragraph that you overlooked), disappear without responding. This is the anonymous Internet; slipping away without consequence or civility is your privilege.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Trolling is making a deliberately inflammatory remark, one that you know perfectly well is baloney, just to get a rise out of other people. Trolling is an art. Trolling works just fine for an audience of one (say, a journalist), but of course the real fun is trolling on public bulletin boards where you can get dozens of people screaming at you simultaneously. Comments on religion, politics or Mac-vs.-Windows are always good bets. The talented troll sits back to enjoy the fireworks with a smirk, and never, ever responds to the responses.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Don’t let generalities slip by. Don’t tolerate simplifications for the sake of a non-technical audience.

It’s so true, the autonomy gives authors a “right to speed” as it were.  People think they’re entitled to say what they want, without thought of reprisal, since they’re behind a veil of ones and zeros.  Hopefully someone will post about how wrong _I_ am for re-posting this article.  ”_Last week in [my Times column](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/12/technology/circuits/12pogue.html), I referred to the five-note “Intel Inside” jingle often heard in TV ads. At least a dozen readers e-mailed me to inform me that the jingle is actually four notes, not five. As I’ve come to expect, some of these readers expressed, ahem, somewhat more anger than the circumstances might have seemed to require. “If you have that much trouble counting on one hand,” one wrote, “you shouldn’t be reviewing technology. Maybe a four-year-old can help you out next time.”_\n\n_I replied to this reader that I’m including the first “ping” in my tally. In that case, there ARE five notes in the jingle, as you can hear [here](http://www.whitwell.ndo.co.uk/musicthing/sounds/intel.mp3). But my correspondent never wrote back. That, of course, would violate the rules for being an Internet pill, reprinted here in their entirety, courtesy of the Pills of the American Internet Neighborhood Society (PAINS): RULES FOR TROLLS AND PILLS_\n\n**RULES FOR TROLLS AND PILLS**\n\nWHEREAS, 95 percent of all the e-mail received by critics and columnists is civil, friendly or respectfully constructive;\n\nbut WHEREAS, this is the Internet age, and we’re all anonymous and can avoid making eye contact forever;\n\nand WHEREAS, there’s so much information overload, a little heat and drama on your part may be necessary just to be heard above the din;\n\nand WHEREAS, many of those who fire off potshots are missing out on some of the best techniques for effective snippiness;\n\nTHEREFORE let us now post the rules for membership in the Pills of the American Internet Neighborhood Society.\n\n1. Use the strongest language possible. Calling names is always effective, and four-letter words show that you mean business.\n\n2. Having a violent opinion of something doesn’t require you to actually try it yourself. After all, plenty of people heatedly object to books they haven’t read or movies they haven’t seen. Heck, you can imagine perfectly well if something is any good.\n\n3. If it’s a positive review that you didn’t like, call the reviewer a “fanboy.” Do not entertain the notion that the product, service, show, movie, book or restaurant might, in fact, be good. Instead, assume that the reviewer has received payment from the reviewee. Work in the word “shill” if possible.\n\n4. If it’s a negative review, call the reviewer a “basher” and describe the review as a “hatchet job.” Accuse him of being paid off by the reviewee’s _rival_.\n\n5. If it’s a mixed review, ignore the passages that balance the argument. Pretend that the entire review is all positive or all negative. Refer to it either as a “rave” or a “slam.”\n\n6. If you find a sentence early in the article that rubs you the wrong way, you are by no means obligated to finish reading. Stop right where you are–express your anger while it’s still good and hot! What are the odds that the writer is going to say anything else relevant to your point later in the piece, anyway?\n\n7. If the writer responds to your e-mail with evidence that you’re wrong (for example, by citing a paragraph that you overlooked), disappear without responding. This is the anonymous Internet; slipping away without consequence or civility is your privilege.\n\n8. Trolling is making a deliberately inflammatory remark, one that you know perfectly well is baloney, just to get a rise out of other people. Trolling is an art. Trolling works just fine for an audience of one (say, a journalist), but of course the real fun is trolling on public bulletin boards where you can get dozens of people screaming at you simultaneously. Comments on religion, politics or Mac-vs.-Windows are always good bets. The talented troll sits back to enjoy the fireworks with a smirk, and never, ever responds to the responses.\n\n9. Don’t let generalities slip by. Don’t tolerate simplifications for the sake of a non-technical audience. Ignore conditional words like “generally,” “usually” and “most.” If you read a sentence that says, for example, “The VisionPhone is among the first consumer videophones,” cite the reviewer’s ignorance and laziness for failing to mention the prototype developed by AT&T for the 1964 World’s Fair. Send copies of your note to the publication’s publisher and, if possible, its advertisers.\n\nAnd there you have it: the nine habits of highly effective pills. After all: if you’re going to be a miserable curmudgeon, you may as well do it up right!\n","updated":1414378977000,"excerpt":"","_id":"ayma5eqqe6x5jhuk","photos":[],"link":""},{"author":"phil","comments":true,"date":1222856782000,"layout":"post","slug":"how-to-become-a-hacker","title":"How to become a hacker","wordpress_id":1095,"categories":["2sa89tbutq6l16al","bqb6twkfs88kjglc","yyw0q6vjqbcy4gs7"],"tags":["jjkb92cfj8m8tx7i","p422vbse3ljyc2pr","uncsgiz3gcxop8eo","y4x2m41veknld344","hoal945rhquid1ro","1w8uwrug5tcehu5x","g08vm08jbxa7tay9"],"content":"<p>[caption id=”attachment_1098” align=”alignright” width=”140” caption=”The Glider: A Universal Hacker Emblem “]<a href=\"http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/140px-glidersvg1.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\"><img src=\"http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/140px-glidersvg1.png\" alt=\"Glider - ESR&#39;s hacker emblem\"></a>[/caption]</p>\n<p>There has long been a movement in the geek community to expunge the negative thoughts attached to the word hacker, the image to the right <a href=\"http://www.catb.org/hacker-emblem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">The Glider</a>, being one of the latest and most visible.

I remember reading about <a href=\"https://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Installation_Guide/ch-kickstart2.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">kickstart</a>, which was <a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Red Hat</a>‘s way of automating the install process, but <a href=\"http://debian.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Debian GNU/Linux</a> (and by extension <a href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Ubuntu Linux</a>) support  <a href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">preseed</a>. From Debian’s wiki, “<em>Preseeding provides a way to set answers to questions asked during the installation process, without having to manually enter the answers while the installation is running. This makes it possible to fully automate most types of installation and even offers some features not available during normal installations.</em>“ So preseeding automates the install of the OS, the questions that you’d normally need to answer interactively are predetermined, and defined by a supplied configuration file, and sometimes boot parameters. So while Ubuntu is known for it’s user-friendly OS installer, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquity_(software\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Ubiquity</a>), preseeding the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian-Installer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Debian-Installer</a>  (also known as “d-i”) is the recommended method for automating Ubuntu installations and for building custom install CDs. With this in mind I set out to build a preseed config file that would automate installs of virtual KVM machines we were provisioning at a gig, but looking at how I do such bare-bones base installs, this would work for most of my normal Debian installs at home too.<a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p>Here is what I came up with to install Debian Squeeze to a system with the first harddrive on the SATA connector (/dev/sda), if you cut and paste this it won’t be too hard to modify it for your needs:</p>\n<pre><code># Debian squeeze server preseed file - to automate this, at boot:\n# <span class=\"operator\"><span class=\"keyword\">install</span> auto=<span class=\"literal\">true</span> priority=critical preseed/url=http://<span class=\"keyword\">DOMAIN</span>.COM/path/preseed.cfg\n#\n### Localization\nd-i debian-installer/<span class=\"keyword\">language</span> <span class=\"keyword\">string</span> en\nd-i debian-installer/country <span class=\"keyword\">string</span> US\nd-i debian-installer/locale <span class=\"keyword\">string</span> en_US\n# Keyboard selection.\nd-i console-keymaps-<span class=\"keyword\">at</span>/keymap <span class=\"keyword\">select</span> us\nd-i keyboard-configuration/xkb-keymap <span class=\"keyword\">select</span> us\n### Network configuration\n# <span class=\"keyword\">Any</span> hostname <span class=\"keyword\">and</span> <span class=\"keyword\">domain</span> <span class=\"keyword\">names</span> assigned <span class=\"keyword\">from</span> dhcp take precedence over\n# <span class=\"keyword\">values</span> <span class=\"keyword\">set</span> here.

First, at the bottom of your preseed file, have something like this:</p>\n<pre><code># post <span class=\"operator\"><span class=\"keyword\">install</span> script\nd-i preseed/late_command <span class=\"keyword\">string</span> \\\n    cd /target;</span> \\\n    wget http://DOMAIN.COM/path/post-<span class=\"operator\"><span class=\"keyword\">install</span>.sh;</span> \\\n    chmod +x ./post-<span class=\"operator\"><span class=\"keyword\">install</span>.sh;</span> \\\n    chroot ./ ./post-<span class=\"operator\"><span class=\"keyword\">install</span>.sh;</span> \\\n    rm -f ./post-<span class=\"operator\"><span class=\"keyword\">install</span>.sh</span>\n</code></pre><p>And make sure you have that ‘post-install.sh’ file in place. The file is a simple BASH script that the installer will initiate in a chroot environment after the first boot. Looking at my example it’s pretty basic, but the point is, you could do anything at this point, from installing extra packages :</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"shebang\">#!/bin/bash\n</span>\n<span class=\"built_in\">echo</span> <span class=\"string\">\"Post install started on `date`\"</span> &gt; /root/manifest\n\n<span class=\"built_in\">echo</span> <span class=\"string\">\"* Updating Apt sources...\"</span> &gt;&gt; /root/manifest\nwget <span class=\"string\">\"<span class=\"variable\">$SCRIPTURL</span>/sources.list\"</span>\ncp sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n<span class=\"built_in\">echo</span> <span class=\"string\">\"* Updating system...\"</span> &gt;&gt; /root/manifest\napt-get update\napt-get -y upgrade\napt-get -y install monit screen\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"built_in\">echo</span> <span class=\"string\">\"Post install completed on `date`\"</span> &gt;&gt; /root/manifest\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"keyword\">exit</span> <span class=\"number\">0</span>\n</code></pre><p>So while it currently just does some basic updates and installs monit and screen, it could do anything you want it to do after install; lock things down, setup services, whatever.

I remember reading about [kickstart](https://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Installation_Guide/ch-kickstart2.html), which was [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/)'s way of automating the install process, but [Debian GNU/Linux](http://debian.org) (and by extension [Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com/)) support  [preseed](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed). From Debian's wiki, \"_Preseeding provides a way to set answers to questions asked during the installation process, without having to manually enter the answers while the installation is running. This makes it possible to fully automate most types of installation and even offers some features not available during normal installations._\" So preseeding automates the install of the OS, the questions that you'd normally need to answer interactively are predetermined, and defined by a supplied configuration file, and sometimes boot parameters. So while Ubuntu is known for it's user-friendly OS installer, [Ubiquity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquity_(software)), preseeding the [Debian-Installer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian-Installer)  (also known as \"d-i\") is the recommended method for automating Ubuntu installations and for building custom install CDs. With this in mind I set out to build a preseed config file that would automate installs of virtual KVM machines we were provisioning at a gig, but looking at how I do such bare-bones base installs, this would work for most of my normal Debian installs at home too.<!-- more -->\n\nHere is what I came up with to install Debian Squeeze to a system with the first harddrive on the SATA connector (/dev/sda), if you cut and paste this it won't be too hard to modify it for your needs:\n\n    \n    # Debian squeeze server preseed file - to automate this, at boot:\n    # install auto=true priority=critical preseed/url=http://DOMAIN.COM/path/preseed.cfg\n    #\n    ### Localization\n    d-i debian-installer/language string en\n    d-i debian-installer/country string US\n    d-i debian-installer/locale string en_US\n    # Keyboard selection.\n    d-i console-keymaps-at/keymap select us\n    d-i keyboard-configuration/xkb-keymap select us\n    ### Network configuration\n    # Any hostname and domain names assigned from dhcp take precedence over\n    # values set here.

From Debian’s wiki, “<em>Preseeding provides a way to set answers to questions asked during the installation process, without having to manually enter the answers while the installation is running. This makes it possible to fully automate most types of installation and even offers some features not available during normal installations.</em>“ So preseeding automates the install of the OS, the questions that you’d normally need to answer interactively are predetermined, and defined by a supplied configuration file, and sometimes boot parameters. So while Ubuntu is known for it’s user-friendly OS installer, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquity_(software\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Ubiquity</a>), preseeding the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian-Installer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Debian-Installer</a>  (also known as “d-i”) is the recommended method for automating Ubuntu installations and for building custom install CDs. With this in mind I set out to build a preseed config file that would automate installs of virtual KVM machines we were provisioning at a gig, but looking at how I do such bare-bones base installs, this would work for most of my normal Debian installs at home too.","_id":"fvua41246wnxf2lj","photos":[],"link":""},{"author":"phil","comments":true,"date":1211899138000,"layout":"post","slug":"howto-automatically-reconfigure-xorg-in-debian","title":"HOWTO: automatically reconfigure Xorg in Debian","wordpress_id":794,"categories":["n5v7r5b6mn78je0o","ka94z8kure5sp5r5"],"tags":["9zuk57hgfti8lx8l","hoal945rhquid1ro","gr65l8bdlisg8brf","lrs80k6iauoy8rsr","9lckdgar8sjz2tyy","vws9zw74q90o9o6n"],"content":"<p><img src=\"http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/xorg.png\" alt=\"Xorg logo\">If you’re like me, you’ve messed up your xorg.conf before and wanted to start over with the default that you know dpkg-reconfigure can set it to.

For rsyslog logs, we can use <code>/var/log/messages</code> (which is what CentOS/RHEL use) and <code>/var/log/syslog</code> (which Debian/Ubuntu uses) declarations like we did with Apache, and it covers both of those - making it easy to reuse this config.</p>\n<p>Now let’s start logstash with this new config</p>\n<pre>\njava -jar logstash-1.1.13-flatjar.jar agent -f logstash.conf\n</pre>\n\n<p>And now navigate to your Kibana web view again, wait, or force some events to log by sshing to box, hitting<br>web pages, etc, to see how things show up in Kibana.

Like before, Logstash will catch it, put it in elasticsearch and then it’ll show up in Kibana.<br>We have two steps, the first will require root access on a remote host. First, on the remote<br>host, create a new rsyslog config file that loads the logfiles via rsyslog’s imfile plugin and then ships them to the<br>logserver. Create a new file called <code>/etc/rsyslog.d/logserver.conf</code> with the following</p>\n<pre>\n# From http://cookbook.logstash.net/recipes/rsyslog-agent/rsyslog.conf\n$ModLoad imfile   # Load the imfile input module\n$ModLoad imklog   # for reading kernel log messages\n$ModLoad imuxsock # for reading local syslog messages\n\n# Watch /var/log/apache2/access.log\n$InputFileName /var/log/apache2/access.log\n$InputFileTag apache-access:\n$InputFileStateFile state-apache-access\n$InputRunFileMonitor\n\n# Watch /var/log/apache2/error.log\n$InputFileName /var/log/apache2/error.log\n$InputFileTag apache-error:\n$InputFileStateFile state-apache-error\n$InputRunFileMonitor\n\n# Watch /var/log/mysql/mysql.log\n$InputFileName /var/log/mysql/mysql.log\n$InputFileTag mysql:\n$InputFileStateFile state-mysql\n$InputRunFileMonitor\n\n# Send everything to a logstash server named 'myserver' on port 5544:\n#*.* @@myserver:5544\n*.* @@${IP_OR_HOSTNAME}:5544\n</pre>\nOf course, adjust any log file locations (or add them), and be sure to replace ${IP_OR_HOSTNAME} with the name or IP of your logserver host, and be sure to keep the double @ in there (ie- <code>@@123.4.5.6:5544</code>)\n\nThen restart rsyslog so it will use the new config\n<pre>\n/etc/init.d/rsyslog restart\n</pre>\n\n<p>Back on the logserver, we need to tell our logstash server to listen on :5544 for logs, but we’re also going to rework how it parses syslog events, since there will be more in these than just syslog.

Create a new file called <code>/etc/rsyslog.d/logserver.conf</code> with the following\n \n<pre>\n# From http://cookbook.logstash.net/recipes/rsyslog-agent/rsyslog.conf\n$ModLoad imfile   # Load the imfile input module\n$ModLoad imklog   # for reading kernel log messages\n$ModLoad imuxsock # for reading local syslog messages\n \n# Watch /var/log/apache2/access.log\n$InputFileName /var/log/apache2/access.log\n$InputFileTag apache-access:\n$InputFileStateFile state-apache-access\n$InputRunFileMonitor\n \n# Watch /var/log/apache2/error.log\n$InputFileName /var/log/apache2/error.log\n$InputFileTag apache-error:\n$InputFileStateFile state-apache-error\n$InputRunFileMonitor\n \n# Watch /var/log/mysql/mysql.log\n$InputFileName /var/log/mysql/mysql.log\n$InputFileTag mysql:\n$InputFileStateFile state-mysql\n$InputRunFileMonitor\n \n# Send everything to a logstash server named 'myserver' on port 5544:\n#*.* @@myserver:5544\n*.* @@${IP_OR_HOSTNAME}:5544\n</pre>\nOf course, adjust any log file locations (or add them), and be sure to replace ${IP_OR_HOSTNAME} with the name or IP of your logserver host, and be sure to keep the double @ in there (ie- <code>@@123.4.5.6:5544</code>)\n\nThen restart rsyslog so it will use the new config\n<pre>\n/etc/init.d/rsyslog restart\n</pre>\n \nBack on the logserver, we need to tell our logstash server to listen on :5544 for logs, but we're also going to rework how it parses syslog events, since there will be more in these than just syslog. There's a new filter block to cover that, but again at the end we'll still use the same output, elasticsearch.\n\n<pre>\ninput {\n  stdin {\n    type => \"stdin-type\"\n  }\n \n  file {\n    type => \"syslog\"\n \n    # Wildcards work, here :)\n    path => [ \"/var/log/*.log\", \"/var/log/messages\", \"/var/log/syslog\" ]\n  }\n \n  file {\n    type => \"web\"\n    path => [ \"/var/log/httpd/*.log\", \"/var/log/nginx/*.log\", \"/var/log/apache2/*.log\" ]\n  }\n \n  tcp {\n    port => 5544\n    type => syslog\n  }\n  udp {\n    port => 5544\n    type => syslog\n  }\n}\n \nfilter {\n  grok {\n      type => \"syslog\"\n      pattern => [ \"<%{POSINT:syslog_pri}>%{SYSLOGTIMESTAMP:syslog_timestamp} %{SYSLOGHOST:syslog_hostname} %{DATA:syslog_program}(?:\\[%{POSINT:syslog_pid}\\])?: %{GREEDYDATA:syslog_message}\" ]\n      add_field => [ \"received_at\", \"%{@timestamp}\" ]\n      add_field => [ \"received_from\", \"%{@source_host}\" ]\n  }\n  syslog_pri {\n      type => \"syslog\"\n  }\n  date {\n      type => \"syslog\"\n      match => [ \"syslog_timestamp\", \"MMM  d HH:mm:ss\", \"MMM dd HH:mm:ss\" ]\n  }\n  mutate {\n      type => \"syslog\"\n      exclude_tags => \"_grokparsefailure\"\n      replace => [ \"@source_host\", \"%{syslog_hostname}\" ]\n      replace => [ \"@message\", \"%{syslog_message}\" ]\n  }\n  mutate {\n      type => \"syslog\"\n      remove => [ \"syslog_hostname\", \"syslog_message\", \"syslog_timestamp\" ]\n  }\n}\n\nfilter {\n  grok {\n\ttype => \"apache\"\n        # See the following URL for a complete list of named patterns\n        # logstash/grok ships with by default:\n        # https://github.com/logstash/logstash/tree/master/patterns\n        #\n        # The grok filter will use the below pattern and on successful match use\n        # any captured values as new fields in the event.\n               pattern => \"%{COMBINEDAPACHELOG}\"\n        }\n \n  date {\n        type => \"apache\"\n        # Try to pull the timestamp from the 'timestamp' field (parsed above with\n        # grok).

How did it work, anything I missed? Sound off via Twitter or hit me up via my contact page if you have/need any feedback and I'll update this post as necessary.\n\nNow since I mentioned it, I should tell you a UDP joke, but you may not get it. -- No, that's not mine, but I've heard it online and it's a good one. \n","slug":"howto-build-a-simple-log-server-with-splunk-like-features","updated":1414378977000,"excerpt":"<p>Logging is something that continues to become more and more important, and it used to take great pains to have a centralized log server that everyone could use.

I want to, and have new ideas to implement and try out in the next few months. The two way sharing is a bit hacky, and I don’t like it, the installer creates a <a href=\"https://github.com/philcryer/lipsync/blob/master/install.sh#L155\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">cronjob</a>:  that checks for server changes to sync back every minute - and it tries to avoid conflicts by <a href=\"https://github.com/philcryer/lipsync/blob/master/bin/lipsync#L9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">not running if a sync the other way is happening</a>. Yes, if you’re using 2 computers at once it could get confused, but so far, it’s pretty good - but something I want to improve. I’m also very interested in <a href=\"http://owncloud.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">ownCloud</a>  and using <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/community/unhosted/wiki/RemoteStorage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">remote storage</a> auth protocol like <a href=\"http://unhosted.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Unhosted</a> proposes - these are two things I’d love to integrate into lipsync over the next few months. I really think having something that is all owned by the user, and in full control of the user, is still the ultimate way. Watch the <a href=\"http://lipsync.info/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">lipsync.info</a> site for more details, thanks.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE #3:</strong> Ok, a long, overdue update on this project. I’ve worked on the next version of this ideal that I encourage everyone to checkout and try for themselves. You can get it on Github, and<strong> the project’s name is <a href=\"https://github.com/philcryer/lipsync\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">lipsync</a></strong>. My goal is to make something that is trivial for anyone to setup and use, providing them a ‘Dropbox-like’ experience. This process will also help <a href=\"https://www.yousendit.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">send</a> large files and overcome file size limitations. As before I’ve focused on the backend, server side, part of the game to get that working, but would be happy to work with anyone that wanted to work on a GUI, or integrate this with existing projects, such as <a href=\"http://sparkleshare.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Sparkleshare</a>, which seems to have a great GUI, but a backend that relies on things like Github for storage. So give it a look and remember, the more feedback the better; and as always don’t worry about offending me! Thanks.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE #2:</strong> <em>There was a big influx of new hits/posts on this article last week thanks to <a href=\"http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2010/10/how-to-make-your-own-dropbox-like-sync-and-backup-service/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Lifehacker Australia linking to it</a>, plus they even came up with a <a href=\"http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2010/10/opensource-dropbox.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">pretty sweet logo</a>. It’s v<strong>ery cool that so many are (still) interested in this project - and that’s what it has become; a project. I’ll be releasing code to setup a complete command-line Dropbox like implementation on Linux in about a week. Code will be hosted on github.com and I’m hoping it will spur others to work on cross platform front-ends to talk to it. So far the technology is there, I’m just using what others have built, it’s just a matter of hooking it all up! After all, why reinvent the wheel? (not that I could ;)) </strong>Thanks again for all the comments and support!</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>UPDATE: </strong>__Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this, and the <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/9ol1j/howto_create_your_own_dropbox_clone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Reddit thread</a>, as it has provided some great ideas building off of my concept.  I’m starting to rethink about how we could have version control on top of things, and I’ll update things when I have more to share.  Also, does anyone have <a href=\"http://www.kablink.org/ifolder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">iFolder</a> (thanks for the proper link salubrium) working?  It looks like you need SUSE Linux, which I don’t have access to, plus I know most Novell projects need a <em>ton</em> of Mono dependencies installed to have any of their stuff working, at least on the server side; but it sounds like they have Mac, Linux and Windows clients, which is encouraging.  While for my needs something a bit more ‘close to the bone’ (as below) might be better for the server side, having it be inter-operable with something like iFolder could provide a lot more functionality for others.</em></p>\n<p>First off, if you haven’t tried <a href=\"https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTY0OTQ0MDk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Dropbox</a>, you should check it out; sync all of your computers via the Dropbox servers, <a href=\"https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTY0OTQ0MDk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">their basic free service gives you 2Gigs of space</a> and works cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux).  I use it daily at home and work, and just having a live backup of my main data for my work workstation, my home netbook, and any other computer I need to login to is a huge win.  Plus, I have various ‘shared’ folders that distribute certain data to certain users that I’ve granted access to, this means work details can be updated and automatically distributed to the folks I want to review/use the data.  I recommend everyone try it out, and see how useful it is, it’s turned into a game changer for me.  So a few months ago they made headlines on supporting Linux as they released the client as open source. While this got hopes up for many, it was only the client that was open source, the server is still proprietary.  While slightly disappointing, this is fine, they’re a company trying to make money.  I don’t fault them for this, it’s just that a free, portable service like that would be a killer app.<a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p>Meanwhile at work I’m working on a solution to sync large data clusters online and the project manager described it as the need for ‘Dropbox on steroids’.  Before I had thought it was more complicated, but after thinking about it, I realized he was right.  Look, Dropbox is a great idea, but it obviously is just a melding of rsync, with something watching for file changes to initiate the sync, along with an easy to use front end.  From there I just started looking at ways this could work, and there are more than a few; here’s how I made it work.</p>\n<p>Linux now includes <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotify\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">inotify</a>, which is a kernel subsystem that provides file system event notification.  From there all it took was to find an application that listens to inotify and then kicks off a command when it hears of a change.  I tried a few different applications like inocron, inosync and iwatch, before going with <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/lsyncd/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">lsyncd</a>.   While all of them could work, lsyncd seemed to be the most mature, simple to configure and fast.  Lsyncd uses inotify to watch a specified directory for any new, edited or removed files or directories, and then calls rsync to take care of business.  So let’s get started in making our own open source Dropbox clone with <a href=\"http://debian.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Debian GNU/Linux</a> (lenny)</p>\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"Ladies_and_gentlemen,_start_your_engines_servers!\">Ladies and gentlemen, start your <del>engines</del> servers!</h2>\n<p>First, you need 2 severs; one being the server and the other the client.

There is no official Debian package yet, but it’s simple to build from source and install.

Installing those is as simple as:</p>\n<pre><code>apt-<span class=\"keyword\">get</span> install libxml2-dev build-essential\n</code></pre><p>Now we’ll get the lsyncd code (you can check for a newer version at <a href=\"http://lsyncd.googlecode.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://lsyncd.googlecode.com</a>) and build that:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"title\">wget</span> <span class=\"url\">http://lsyncd.googlecode.com/files/lsyncd-1.26.tar.gz</span>\ntar -zxf lsyncd-<span class=\"number\">1</span>.<span class=\"number\">26</span>.tar.gz\ncd lsyncd-<span class=\"number\">1</span>.<span class=\"number\">26</span>\n./configure\nmake;

From here add some directories and watch how they’re queued up, and then take a look at them on the remote box: from this point out it “just works”. Now give it more to do by adding files and directories, and then the logging for errors while they sync. As it stands the system uses the source system as the preferred environment, so any files that change, or are added or removed, will be processed on the remote system. This is analogous to how Dropbox works, you can use multiple sources (your laptop, your desktop, etc) and their server serves as the remote system, keeping all the clients in line.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>You should now have a basic, working Dropbox style setup for your own personal use. I had this running and used it to sync my netbook back to my home server, and then have my work desktop sync to my home server, so both the netbook and the desktop would stay in sync without me doing anything besides putting files in the specfied folder. For my week long test I ran a directory alongside my Dropbox directory just to see how they both acted, and I didn’t have any failures along the way.</p>\n<p>Now we have is a simple Dropbox style app that is lightweight, with a functional back-end running rsync, which is a known stable app that will scale, and while it doesn’t provide the front-end and web view that Dropbox does, that could be an easy part for a UX developer to tackle. The cool thing is, we have a solution that works, and other options like the apps I described in the beginning, can be dropped in and replace the functionality lsyncd provides in case they can do something better. For now, I’m playing around with it to learn the ins and outs of the system to see how it will behave long term under a much larger store (50Gig to start) to keep in check. I will also work on better integrating this solution it into a working system, and update this tread with init scripts, reports, or maybe even a web view beyond just an index view from Apache or nginx. Ideally we could have a web front end that would intelligently report if a file is complete on the server, and if the file is completely mirrored on another server or client. P2P or Bitorrent would also be really cool to consider with this, and I’m sure there will be more applications for a setup like this once we’ve it around as a resource for a time. Can you think of more applications for this? Did you get it to work? Can you think of a better way to do this?</p>\n","source":"_posts/howto-build-your-own-open-source-dropbox-clone.markdown","raw":"---\nauthor: phil\ncomments: true\ndate: 2009-09-14 23:21:03\nlayout: post\nslug: howto-build-your-own-open-source-dropbox-clone\ntitle: HOWTO build your own open source Dropbox clone\nwordpress_id: 1727\ncategories:\n- geek\n- howto\n- linux\ntags:\n- backup\n- diy\n- dropbox\n- howto\n- linux\n- mirror\n- open source\n- server\n- sync\n---\n\n![I KAN HAZ OPEN-SRC DROPBX?](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/opensource-dropbox.png)****\n\n**UPDATE #4 **It's 2012, and this project is still alive, although I haven't worked on lipsync as much as I should.  I want to, and have new ideas to implement and try out in the next few months. The two way sharing is a bit hacky, and I don't like it, the installer creates a [cronjob](https://github.com/philcryer/lipsync/blob/master/install.sh#L155):  that checks for server changes to sync back every minute - and it tries to avoid conflicts by [not running if a sync the other way is happening](https://github.com/philcryer/lipsync/blob/master/bin/lipsync#L9). Yes, if you're using 2 computers at once it could get confused, but so far, it's pretty good - but something I want to improve. I'm also very interested in [ownCloud](http://owncloud.org/)  and using [remote storage](http://www.w3.org/community/unhosted/wiki/RemoteStorage) auth protocol like [Unhosted](http://unhosted.org/) proposes - these are two things I'd love to integrate into lipsync over the next few months. I really think having something that is all owned by the user, and in full control of the user, is still the ultimate way. Watch the [lipsync.info](http://lipsync.info/) site for more details, thanks.\n\n**UPDATE #3:** Ok, a long, overdue update on this project. I've worked on the next version of this ideal that I encourage everyone to checkout and try for themselves. You can get it on Github, and** the project's name is [lipsync](https://github.com/philcryer/lipsync)**. My goal is to make something that is trivial for anyone to setup and use, providing them a ‘Dropbox-like’ experience. This process will also help [send](https://www.yousendit.com/) large files and overcome file size limitations. As before I've focused on the backend, server side, part of the game to get that working, but would be happy to work with anyone that wanted to work on a GUI, or integrate this with existing projects, such as [Sparkleshare](http://sparkleshare.org/), which seems to have a great GUI, but a backend that relies on things like Github for storage. So give it a look and remember, the more feedback the better; and as always don't worry about offending me! Thanks.\n\n**UPDATE #2:** _There was a big influx of new hits/posts on this article last week thanks to [Lifehacker Australia linking to it](http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2010/10/how-to-make-your-own-dropbox-like-sync-and-backup-service/), plus they even came up with a [pretty sweet logo](http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2010/10/opensource-dropbox.jpg). It's v__ery cool that so many are (still) interested in this project - and that's what it has become; a project. I'll be releasing code to setup a complete command-line Dropbox like implementation on Linux in about a week. Code will be hosted on github.com and I'm hoping it will spur others to work on cross platform front-ends to talk to it. So far the technology is there, I'm just using what others have built, it's just a matter of hooking it all up! After all, why reinvent the wheel? (not that I could ;)) __Thanks again for all the comments and support!_\n\n_**UPDATE: **__Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this, and the [Reddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/9ol1j/howto_create_your_own_dropbox_clone/), as it has provided some great ideas building off of my concept.  I'm starting to rethink about how we could have version control on top of things, and I'll update things when I have more to share.  Also, does anyone have [iFolder](http://www.kablink.org/ifolder) (thanks for the proper link salubrium) working?  It looks like you need SUSE Linux, which I don't have access to, plus I know most Novell projects need a *ton* of Mono dependencies installed to have any of their stuff working, at least on the server side; but it sounds like they have Mac, Linux and Windows clients, which is encouraging.  While for my needs something a bit more 'close to the bone' (as below) might be better for the server side, having it be inter-operable with something like iFolder could provide a lot more functionality for others._\n\nFirst off, if you haven't tried [Dropbox](https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTY0OTQ0MDk), you should check it out; sync all of your computers via the Dropbox servers, [their basic free service gives you 2Gigs of space](https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTY0OTQ0MDk) and works cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux).  I use it daily at home and work, and just having a live backup of my main data for my work workstation, my home netbook, and any other computer I need to login to is a huge win.  Plus, I have various 'shared' folders that distribute certain data to certain users that I've granted access to, this means work details can be updated and automatically distributed to the folks I want to review/use the data.  I recommend everyone try it out, and see how useful it is, it's turned into a game changer for me.  So a few months ago they made headlines on supporting Linux as they released the client as open source. While this got hopes up for many, it was only the client that was open source, the server is still proprietary.  While slightly disappointing, this is fine, they're a company trying to make money.  I don't fault them for this, it's just that a free, portable service like that would be a killer app.<!-- more -->\n\nMeanwhile at work I'm working on a solution to sync large data clusters online and the project manager described it as the need for 'Dropbox on steroids'.  Before I had thought it was more complicated, but after thinking about it, I realized he was right.  Look, Dropbox is a great idea, but it obviously is just a melding of rsync, with something watching for file changes to initiate the sync, along with an easy to use front end.  From there I just started looking at ways this could work, and there are more than a few; here's how I made it work.\n\nLinux now includes [inotify](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotify), which is a kernel subsystem that provides file system event notification.  From there all it took was to find an application that listens to inotify and then kicks off a command when it hears of a change.  I tried a few different applications like inocron, inosync and iwatch, before going with [lsyncd](http://code.google.com/p/lsyncd/).   While all of them could work, lsyncd seemed to be the most mature, simple to configure and fast.  Lsyncd uses inotify to watch a specified directory for any new, edited or removed files or directories, and then calls rsync to take care of business.  So let's get started in making our own open source Dropbox clone with [Debian GNU/Linux](http://debian.org) (lenny)\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n\n## Ladies and gentlemen, start your <del>engines</del> servers!\n\n\nFirst, you need 2 severs; one being the server and the other the client. (you could do this on one host if you wanted to see how it works for a proof of concept)\n\n\n## Install OpenSSH server\n\n\nFirst you'll need to install OpenSSH Server on the remote system:\napt-get install openssh-server\n\n\n## **Configure SSH for Passwordless Logins**\n\n\nYou'll need to configure passwordless logins between the two hosts you want to use, this is how rsync will pass the files back and forth.  I've previously written a [HOWTO on this topic](http://fak3r.com/2006/08/10/howto-passwordless-ssh-logins/), so we'll crib from there.\n\nFirst, generate a key:\n\n    \n    ssh-keygen -t rsa\n\n\n**UPDATE**: actually, it's easier to do it this way\n\n    \n    ssh-keygen -N '' -f ~/.ssh/id_dsa\n\n\n(Enter)\n\nYou shouldn’t have a key stored there yet, but if you do it will prompt you now; make sure you overwrite it.\n\n    \n    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):\n\n\n(Enter)\n\n    \n    Enter same passphrase again:\n\n\n(Enter)\n\nWe’re not using passphrases so logins can be automated, this should only be done for scripts or applications that need this functionality, it’s not for logging into servers lazily, and **it should not be done as root**!\n\nNow, replace REMOTE_SERVER with the hostname or IP that you’re going to call when you SSH to it, and copy the key over to the server:\n\n    \n    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh REMOTE_SERVER 'cat - >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2'\n\n\n**UPDATE: **now you can use ssh-copy-id for this instead (hat tip [briealeida](/briealeida/))\n\n    \n    ssh-copy-id REMOTE_SERVER\n\n\nSet the permissions to a sane level:\n\n    \n    ssh REMOTE_SERVER 'chmod 700 .ssh'\n\n\nLastly, give it a go to see if it worked:\n\n    \n    ssh REMOTE_SERVER\n\n\nYou should be dropped to a prompt on the remote server. If not you may need to redo your .ssh directory, so on both servers:\n\n    \n    `mv ~/.ssh ~/.ssh-old`\n\n\nand goto 10\n\n\n## Install rsync and lsyncd\n\n\nNext up is to install rsync and lsyncd.  First, rsync is simple, and could already be installed (you don't need to run it as a server, just the client), make sure you have it with:\n\n    \n    apt-get install rsync\n\n\nNext is lsyncd.  There is no official Debian package yet, but it's simple to build from source and install.  First off, if you don't have build essentials you'll need them, as well as libxml2-dev to build the lsyncd source.  Installing those is as simple as:\n\n    \n    apt-get install libxml2-dev build-essential\n\n\nNow we'll get the lsyncd code (you can check for a newer version at [http://lsyncd.googlecode.com](http://lsyncd.googlecode.com)) and build that:\n\n    \n    wget http://lsyncd.googlecode.com/files/lsyncd-1.26.tar.gz\n    tar -zxf lsyncd-1.26.tar.gz\n    cd lsyncd-1.26\n    ./configure\n    make; make install\n\n\nThis install does not install the configuration file, so we'll do that manually now:\n\n    \n    cp lsyncd.conf.xml /etc/\n\n\n\n\n## Configure lsyncd\n\n\nNext up, we'll edit the configuration file now located in /etc  The file is a simple, well documented XML file, and mine ended up like so - just be sure to change the source and target hosts and paths to work with your systems:\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><lsyncd version=\"1.25\">  </span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <settings> </span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <logfile filename=\"/var/log/lsyncd\"/> </span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <!--Specify the rsync (or other) binary to call--> </span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <binary filename=\"/usr/bin/rsync\"/> </span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <!--uncomment to create a file containing pid of the daemon--> </span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <!--pidfile filename=\"/tmp/pid\"/--> </span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <!--this specifies the arguments handled to the rsync (or other) binary. </span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> option is the default literal. only '%r' will be replaced with r when recursive</span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> operation is wanted, d when not. exclude file will be replaced with -exclude-from FILE </span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> source will be the source path to sync from destination will be the</span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> destination path to sync to --> </span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <callopts> </span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <option text=\"-lt%r\"/> </span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <option text=\"--delete\"/> </span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <exclude -file/> </span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <source /> </span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <destination /> </span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </callopts>  </span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </settings> </span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <directory> </span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <source path=\"/var/www/sync_test\"/> </span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <target path=\"desthost::module/\"/> </span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <!-- or it can also be an absolute path for localhost </span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <target path=\"/absolute/path/to/target\"> --> </span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </directory> </span>\n\n\n\n    \n    <span style=\"color: #000000;\"></lsyncd> </span>\n\n\n\n\n## Launch lsyncd in debug for testing\n\n\nWe're ready to give it a go, may as well run it in debug for fun and to learn how lsyncd does what it does:\n\n    \n    lsyncd --conf /etc/lsyncd.conf.xml --debug\n\n\nWatch for errors, if none are found, continue.\n\n\n## Add files and watch them sync\n\n\nNow we just need to copy some files into this directory on the source box:\n\n    \n    /var/www/sync_test\n\n\nAnd again, watch for any errors on the screen, if these come back as a failed connection it'll be an SSH/key issue, common, and not too difficult to solve. From here add some directories and watch how they're queued up, and then take a look at them on the remote box: from this point out it \"just works\". Now give it more to do by adding files and directories, and then the logging for errors while they sync. As it stands the system uses the source system as the preferred environment, so any files that change, or are added or removed, will be processed on the remote system. This is analogous to how Dropbox works, you can use multiple sources (your laptop, your desktop, etc) and their server serves as the remote system, keeping all the clients in line.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\nYou should now have a basic, working Dropbox style setup for your own personal use. I had this running and used it to sync my netbook back to my home server, and then have my work desktop sync to my home server, so both the netbook and the desktop would stay in sync without me doing anything besides putting files in the specfied folder. For my week long test I ran a directory alongside my Dropbox directory just to see how they both acted, and I didn't have any failures along the way.\n\nNow we have is a simple Dropbox style app that is lightweight, with a functional back-end running rsync, which is a known stable app that will scale, and while it doesn't provide the front-end and web view that Dropbox does, that could be an easy part for a UX developer to tackle. The cool thing is, we have a solution that works, and other options like the apps I described in the beginning, can be dropped in and replace the functionality lsyncd provides in case they can do something better. For now, I'm playing around with it to learn the ins and outs of the system to see how it will behave long term under a much larger store (50Gig to start) to keep in check. I will also work on better integrating this solution it into a working system, and update this tread with init scripts, reports, or maybe even a web view beyond just an index view from Apache or nginx. Ideally we could have a web front end that would intelligently report if a file is complete on the server, and if the file is completely mirrored on another server or client. P2P or Bitorrent would also be really cool to consider with this, and I'm sure there will be more applications for a setup like this once we've it around as a resource for a time. Can you think of more applications for this? Did you get it to work? Can you think of a better way to do this?\n","updated":1414378977000,"excerpt":"<p><img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/opensource-dropbox.png\" alt=\"I KAN HAZ OPEN-SRC DROPBX?\"><em>**</em></p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE #4 </strong>It’s 2012, and this project is still alive, although I haven’t worked on lipsync as much as I should.  I want to, and have new ideas to implement and try out in the next few months. The two way sharing is a bit hacky, and I don’t like it, the installer creates a <a href=\"https://github.com/philcryer/lipsync/blob/master/install.sh#L155\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">cronjob</a>:  that checks for server changes to sync back every minute - and it tries to avoid conflicts by <a href=\"https://github.com/philcryer/lipsync/blob/master/bin/lipsync#L9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">not running if a sync the other way is happening</a>. Yes, if you’re using 2 computers at once it could get confused, but so far, it’s pretty good - but something I want to improve. I’m also very interested in <a href=\"http://owncloud.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">ownCloud</a>  and using <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/community/unhosted/wiki/RemoteStorage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">remote storage</a> auth protocol like <a href=\"http://unhosted.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Unhosted</a> proposes - these are two things I’d love to integrate into lipsync over the next few months. I really think having something that is all owned by the user, and in full control of the user, is still the ultimate way. Watch the <a href=\"http://lipsync.info/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">lipsync.info</a> site for more details, thanks.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE #3:</strong> Ok, a long, overdue update on this project. I’ve worked on the next version of this ideal that I encourage everyone to checkout and try for themselves. You can get it on Github, and<strong> the project’s name is <a href=\"https://github.com/philcryer/lipsync\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">lipsync</a></strong>. My goal is to make something that is trivial for anyone to setup and use, providing them a ‘Dropbox-like’ experience. This process will also help <a href=\"https://www.yousendit.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">send</a> large files and overcome file size limitations. As before I’ve focused on the backend, server side, part of the game to get that working, but would be happy to work with anyone that wanted to work on a GUI, or integrate this with existing projects, such as <a href=\"http://sparkleshare.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Sparkleshare</a>, which seems to have a great GUI, but a backend that relies on things like Github for storage. So give it a look and remember, the more feedback the better; and as always don’t worry about offending me! Thanks.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE #2:</strong> <em>There was a big influx of new hits/posts on this article last week thanks to <a href=\"http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2010/10/how-to-make-your-own-dropbox-like-sync-and-backup-service/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Lifehacker Australia linking to it</a>, plus they even came up with a <a href=\"http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2010/10/opensource-dropbox.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">pretty sweet logo</a>. It’s v<strong>ery cool that so many are (still) interested in this project - and that’s what it has become; a project. I’ll be releasing code to setup a complete command-line Dropbox like implementation on Linux in about a week. Code will be hosted on github.com and I’m hoping it will spur others to work on cross platform front-ends to talk to it. So far the technology is there, I’m just using what others have built, it’s just a matter of hooking it all up! After all, why reinvent the wheel? (not that I could ;)) </strong>Thanks again for all the comments and support!</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>UPDATE: </strong>__Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this, and the <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/9ol1j/howto_create_your_own_dropbox_clone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Reddit thread</a>, as it has provided some great ideas building off of my concept.  I’m starting to rethink about how we could have version control on top of things, and I’ll update things when I have more to share.  Also, does anyone have <a href=\"http://www.kablink.org/ifolder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">iFolder</a> (thanks for the proper link salubrium) working?  It looks like you need SUSE Linux, which I don’t have access to, plus I know most Novell projects need a <em>ton</em> of Mono dependencies installed to have any of their stuff working, at least on the server side; but it sounds like they have Mac, Linux and Windows clients, which is encouraging.  While for my needs something a bit more ‘close to the bone’ (as below) might be better for the server side, having it be inter-operable with something like iFolder could provide a lot more functionality for others.</em></p>\n<p>First off, if you haven’t tried <a href=\"https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTY0OTQ0MDk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Dropbox</a>, you should check it out; sync all of your computers via the Dropbox servers, <a href=\"https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTY0OTQ0MDk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">their basic free service gives you 2Gigs of space</a> and works cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux).  I use it daily at home and work, and just having a live backup of my main data for my work workstation, my home netbook, and any other computer I need to login to is a huge win.  Plus, I have various ‘shared’ folders that distribute certain data to certain users that I’ve granted access to, this means work details can be updated and automatically distributed to the folks I want to review/use the data.  I recommend everyone try it out, and see how useful it is, it’s turned into a game changer for me.  So a few months ago they made headlines on supporting Linux as they released the client as open source. While this got hopes up for many, it was only the client that was open source, the server is still proprietary.  While slightly disappointing, this is fine, they’re a company trying to make money.

Now, enter a web server named <a href=\"http://nginx.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">nginx</a> (engine x), written by a Russian hacker.  It’s already proved it’s meddle by running some of the largest Russian sites for years now.

It also does cool things like load balancing, reverse proxy, IMAP and POP proxy, etc, so I can see it being used in a variety of ways on a network.  It took me some time to understand <a href=\"http://wiki.codemongers.com/Main\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">how to configure it</a>, which was a case of me just making it harder than it really is, so I wanted to post it here.

**I'm reworking my config blending in the security ideas found on [camomel.org](https://calomel.org/nginx.html) they're really thought things through on this, this should make for a very secure environment.\n\nI'm always trying new software, and with the webserver I've moved from Apache 1.3 to 2.0 to 2.2, and then later I moved everything over to Lighttpd, which I've liked, save for some memory issues that popped up.  Now, enter a web server named [nginx](http://nginx.net/) (engine x), written by a Russian hacker.  It's already proved it's meddle by running some of the largest Russian sites for years now.  It has the [speed of Lighttpd](http://superjared.com/entry/benching-lighttpd-vs-nginx-static-files/), but with none of that memory weirdness, plus it uses a fraction of the CPU, so scaling should be smooth for highly visited sites.  It also does cool things like load balancing, reverse proxy, IMAP and POP proxy, etc, so I can see it being used in a variety of ways on a network.  It took me some time to understand [how to configure it](http://wiki.codemongers.com/Main), which was a case of me just making it harder than it really is, so I wanted to post it here.  Look for updates as we go along, but this is currently backing a Production site I manage.\n\n    \n    user\t\t\t\t\twww-data www-data;\n    worker_processes  \t\t\t5;\n    pid \t\t\t\t\t/var/run/nginx.pid;\n    events {\n    worker_connections 1024;\n    }\n    http {\n    include\t\t\t\t/etc/nginx/mime.types;\n    default_type\t\t\tapplication/octet-stream;\n    log_format main \t\t'$remote_addr $host $remote_user [$time_local] \"$request\" '\n    '$status $body_bytes_sent \"$http_referer\" \"$http_user_agent\" '\n    '\"$request_time\" \"$gzip_ratio\"';\n    access_log\t\t\t/var/log/nginx/access.log  main;\n    error_log\t\t\t/var/log/nginx/error.log;\n    sendfile \t\t\ton;\n    tcp_nopush        \t\ton;\n    tcp_nodelay      \t\toff;\n    keepalive_timeout\t\t65;\n    gzip\t\t\t\ton;\n    gzip_http_version\t\t1.1;\n    gzip_vary\t\t\ton;\n    gzip_comp_level \t\t6;\n    gzip_buffers\t\t\t16 8k;\n    #gzip_proxied\t\t\texpired no-cache no-store private auth;\n    gzip_proxied \t\t\tany;\n    gzip_min_length\t\t\t1000;\n    gzip_types\t\t\ttext/plain text/html text/css application/json application/x-javascript\n    text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;\n    server {\n    listen\t\t\t80;\n    client_max_body_size\t50M;\n    server_name \t\tserver.domain.com;\n    root \t\t\t/var/www;\n    index  \t\t\tindex.html index.php;\n    access_log  \t\t/var/log/nginx/access.log  main;\n    error_page   \t\t500 502 503 504  /500.html;\n    location = /500.html {\n    root\t\t/var/www;\n    }\n    location ~* ^.+.(jpg|jpeg|gif)$ {\n    root\t\t/var/www;\n    expires         30d;\n    }\n    location ~ \\.php$ {\n    include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;\n    fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;\n    fastcgi_index index.php;\n    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /var/www$fastcgi_script_name;\n    fastcgi_param QUERY_STRING $query_string;\n    fastcgi_param REQUEST_METHOD $request_method;\n    fastcgi_param CONTENT_TYPE $content_type;\n    fastcgi_param CONTENT_LENGTH $content_length;\n    }\n    }\n    }\n","updated":1414378977000,"excerpt":"","_id":"f1fngg0iy4eq1nl7","photos":[],"link":""},{"author":"phil","comments":true,"date":1219787150000,"layout":"post","slug":"howto-conky-config-conkyrc-for-debian-part-2","title":"HOWTO: conky config (conkyrc) for Debian Part 2","wordpress_id":916,"categories":["n5v7r5b6mn78je0o"],"tags":["302u2lpgx8cr98td","rmvi8wf5ltq0sa1r","layzkhnimhq4uu9s","i6705qanr7s4bbo4","9zuk57hgfti8lx8l","818jeliltyrc267d","v2mnyrax941lw67i","hoal945rhquid1ro","wa0cgoqzmt4t7ukb"],"content":"<p><a href=\"http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/conky-unix-program-screen-shot.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\"><img src=\"http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/conky-unix-program-screen-shot.png\" alt=\"\"></a>I changed around my <a href=\"http://conky.sourceforge.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Conky</a> config, and it’s something you could do forever, but it’s great because it can be as heavy or light as you want it.

I knew I could do this in Linux, but didn’t know how.  Here is how I did it with Debian GNU/Linux (testing - Lenny).  First I installed the GTK+ app, <a href=\"http://fixounet.free.fr/avidemux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Avidemux</a> (don’t worry, we’ll get back to the commandline soon).  The I opened the AVI in Avidemux - after it imported it I clicked on FILE -&gt; SAVE -&gt; SAVE VIDEO - then choose where to save the file.  I saved it as movie.mpg so it would work with my next step.  This took some time for me, even with my duo-core 1.6Mhz 1Gig RAM laptop, but once it was complete I could play the mpg file in multimedia apps, so it worked.  Now we need to make it into the format that you can burn to DVD.  These are the weird looking folders named VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS that you’ll burn to the root of the DVD.  To build this from an mpg is pretty easy, you need to install the commandline app <a href=\"http://dvdauthor.sourceforge.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">dvdauthor</a>.  Once this is downloaded we need a simple XML file to tell dvdauthor what to do, so I created a base/simple one - open your text editor of choice (vim ftw!) and create a new file:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"keyword\">vi</span> dvdauthor.xml\n</code></pre><p>with the contents (NOTE: change all ( and )s to brackets, apparently neither the pre or code tag accepts brackets in them in wordpress - reminder to self, fix this):</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"list\">(<span class=\"title\">dvdauthor</span> dest=<span class=\"string\">\"DVD\"</span>)</span>\n  <span class=\"list\">(<span class=\"title\">vmgm</span> /)</span>\n   <span class=\"list\">(<span class=\"title\">titleset</span>)</span>\n     <span class=\"list\">(<span class=\"title\">titles</span>)</span>\n       <span class=\"list\">(<span class=\"title\">pgc</span>)</span>\n         <span class=\"list\">(<span class=\"title\">vob</span> file=<span class=\"string\">\"movie.mpg\"</span> chapters=<span class=\"string\">\"0,15:00,30:00,45:00,1:00:00\"</span>/)</span>\n       <span class=\"list\">(<span class=\"title\">/pgc</span>)</span>\n      <span class=\"list\">(<span class=\"title\">/titles</span>)</span>\n   <span class=\"list\">(<span class=\"title\">/titleset</span>)</span>\n</code></pre><p>Now run dvdauthor referring to new XML file:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"title\">dvdauthor</span> -x dvdauthor.xml\n</code></pre><p>When it’s done you’ll have a new directory called DVD, with the contents VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS.  Open your favorite DVD burning app (I recommend <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnomebaker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">GnomeBaker</a>) and place those two direcotries in the root of the DVD and burn.  Notice that in the XML file we called out chapters as 0, 15, 30, 45, 1 hour - obviously these can be further tweaked to be ‘real’ chapters, or left out all together.  I’m sure there’s a GUI DVD authoring app that helps you do this, if you figure it out post below and let me know.

The I opened the AVI in Avidemux - after it imported it I clicked on FILE -> SAVE -> SAVE VIDEO - then choose where to save the file.  I saved it as movie.mpg so it would work with my next step.  This took some time for me, even with my duo-core 1.6Mhz 1Gig RAM laptop, but once it was complete I could play the mpg file in multimedia apps, so it worked.  Now we need to make it into the format that you can burn to DVD.  These are the weird looking folders named VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS that you'll burn to the root of the DVD.  To build this from an mpg is pretty easy, you need to install the commandline app [dvdauthor](http://dvdauthor.sourceforge.net/).  Once this is downloaded we need a simple XML file to tell dvdauthor what to do, so I created a base/simple one - open your text editor of choice (vim ftw!) and create a new file:\n\n    \n    vi dvdauthor.xml\n\n\nwith the contents (NOTE: change all ( and )s to brackets, apparently neither the pre or code tag accepts brackets in them in wordpress - reminder to self, fix this):\n\n    \n    (dvdauthor dest=\"DVD\")\n      (vmgm /)\n       (titleset)\n         (titles)\n           (pgc)\n             (vob file=\"movie.mpg\" chapters=\"0,15:00,30:00,45:00,1:00:00\"/)\n           (/pgc)\n          (/titles)\n       (/titleset)\n\n\nNow run dvdauthor referring to new XML file:\n\n    \n    dvdauthor -x dvdauthor.xml\n\n\nWhen it's done you'll have a new directory called DVD, with the contents VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS.  Open your favorite DVD burning app (I recommend [GnomeBaker](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnomebaker)) and place those two direcotries in the root of the DVD and burn.  Notice that in the XML file we called out chapters as 0, 15, 30, 45, 1 hour - obviously these can be further tweaked to be 'real' chapters, or left out all together.  I'm sure there's a GUI DVD authoring app that helps you do this, if you figure it out post below and let me know.

Of course a SQL injection attack has little to do with the database (well, as long as it’s still SQL based at least (nod to <a href=\"http://couchdb.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">CouchDB</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mongodb.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">MongoDB</a>)), and more with the code that calls it, and how that code deals with sanitizing inputs.

To show that it’s working I logged into a MySQL database, first directly, on port 3306:</p>\n<pre><code># mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -u dbadmin -p\nEnter password:\nWelcome to the MySQL monitor.

A bit of a note, this wasn’t directly documented in my wp-config.php file, so to change the port, you just add a colon and the port number at then end of localhost, or your DB hostname, so it looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>define(<span class=\"attribute\">'DB_HOST</span>', <span class=\"attribute\">'localhost</span>&lt;<span class=\"keyword\">strong</span>&gt;:<span class=\"number\">3305</span>&lt;/<span class=\"keyword\">strong</span>&gt;');\n</code></pre><p>I bring this up because most other configs will include a seperate line for the port, but hey, this works too, it was just a little ‘gotcha’ that I had to Google.  Now GreenSQL is protecting my websites, including fak3r, and I expect to only expand upon this as I learn more ways to protect my servers from the wilds of the Internet.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: While some will whine that GreenSQL “only” supports MySQL and Postgresql, when I first looked into this they were only supporting MySQL - and that was last month, so I suspect they’ll cover things like MSSQL and even Oracle in the future.

They sum things up nice and sweet with, “GreenSQL is an Open Source database firewall used to protect databases from SQL injection attacks. GreenSQL works as a proxy for SQL commands and has built in support for MySQL &amp; PostgreSQL . The logic is based on evaluation of SQL commands using a risk scoring matrix as well as blocking known db administrative commands (DROP, CREATE, etc).

Now, I don’t want to start a flamewar here, but what’s the deal with… no, just kidding, I technically have tshirts from both Chef and Puppet, so I’m as impartial as you can get! Since a new gig I have starting up soon promises to make me into the <em>top chef</em> in the office, I thought it was time to dust off my skills with a new HOWTO to get Chef installed, using Vagrant, started and configured.

While we’re there we’ll also download the VirtualBox 4.2.16 Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack.

Now, I don't want to start a flamewar here, but what's the deal with... no, just kidding, I technically have tshirts from both Chef and Puppet, so I'm as impartial as you can get! Since a new gig I have starting up soon promises to make me into the _top chef_ in the office, I thought it was time to dust off my skills with a new HOWTO to get Chef installed, using Vagrant, started and configured. Bonus, I found that it's actually easier than it used to be to get up to snuff, now it can be condensed into a few steps.\n<ul>\n\t<li>Install needed software</li>\n\t<li>Configure Vagrant with a base box definition</li>\n\t<li>Configure Chef by adding cookbook with Librarian-chef</li>\n\t<li>Tell Vagrant about the new cookbook</li>\n\t<li>Build a vagrant instance, then have Chef-solo install a webserver on it</li>\n</ul>\n Simple huh? So let's get started.\n<!--more-->\n## Install needed software\n### Install Virtualbox\n#### Debian\nFor this example I'm running [Debian GNU/Linux](http://www.debian.org/) on the **Jessie** (testing) branch. Regardless, we need to have _contrib_ in our <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> to get Virtualbox\n<pre>deb http://http.debian.net/debian/ jessie main contrib</pre>\n \nIf you already have a line with _main_ in it, just add _contrib_ to the end\n<pre>apt-get update</pre>\n \nNow we'll install it, with some headers that it may find useful \n<pre>apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r|sed 's,[^-]*-[^-]*-,,') virtualbox</pre>\n \nThat's it, now by default this setups up Virtualbox to run on boot, which I don't want, so I changed `LOAD_VBOXDRV_MODULE` in `/etc/default/virtualbox` to `0`\n<pre>sed -s -i 's/\\=1/\\=0/' /etc/default/virtualbox</pre>\n \n#### Mac OS X\nFor this example I'm running on my (t)rusty Apple MacBook Pro (5,5 2009) with 4 Gig RAM. All we need to do is visit the [VirtualBox download page](http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and grab the package for OS X hosts x86/amd64. While we're there we'll also download the VirtualBox 4.2.16 Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack. Once downloaded click on the VirtualBox dmg, install it as normal, then open the VirtualBox Extension Pack, it will automatically open in VirutalBox and install, no big drama there, and we're done. \n\nThe rest of the doc is the same independant of what you're running this on.\n\n### Install Vagrant\n \nNow we'll install [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/), now while while your repo __may__ have a version of vagrant to install, __don't install it__! Those are always older than what [rubygems](http://rubygems.org/) provides, plus somewhere down the line it __will__ cause breakage; trust me, [I've done it before](https://fak3r.com/2009/11/18/ruby-on-rails-gem-install-versus-apt-get/). So, first install rubygems\n<pre>git clone https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.git\ncd rubygems\nruby setup.rb</pre>\n \nNow use rubygems to install it, then the rest of the stuff we need\n<pre>gem install vagrant</pre>\n\n### Install Chef\n\nAgain, we'll install via gem, so nothing surprising here\n<pre>gem install chef</pre>\n\nand then the same to install librarian-chef \n<pre>gem install librarian-chef</pre>\n\n## Configure Vagrant with a base box definition \n\nAdd a box to Vagrant, then tell it about it\n\n<pre>vagrant box add \"CentOS 6.4 x86_64 Minimal\" http://developer.nrel.gov/downloads/vagrant-boxes/CentOS-6.4-x86_64-v20130427.box\nmkdir dev\ncd dev\nmkdir vagrant \nvagrant init</pre>\n\nNow edit the <code>Vagrant</code> file to tell it about our box's new name. To do so,  change\n<pre>config.vm.box = \"base\"</pre>\nto\n<pre>config.vm.box = \"CentOS 6.4 x86_64 Minimal\"</pre>\n\n##Configure Chef by adding cookbook with Librarian-chef\n<pre>mkdir chef\ncd chef\nlibrarian-chef init</pre>\n \nNow edit the <code>Cheffile</code> file to tell it about what we want installed. To do so,  uncomment\n<pre>cookbook 'apache2', '>= 1.0.0'</pre>\n\nNow update the cookbooks with Librarian\n<pre>librarian-chef update</pre>\n\nNotice the apache2 cookbook has been download and placed in the newly created 'cookbooks' directory\n\n##Tell Vagrant about the new cookbook \n<pre>cd -\nvi Vagrantfile</pre>\n\nTell Vagrant where to find the apache2 cookbook, adding this block near the end\n<pre>config.vm.provision :chef_solo do |chef|\n\tchef.cookbooks_path = \"chef/cookbooks\"\n\tchef.add_recipe \"apache2\"\nend</pre>\n\n##Build a vagrant instance, then have Chef-solo install a webserver on it. \n\nBring up the box\n<pre>vagrant up</pre>\n\n*IF* everything works, you'll see something like the following\n\n<pre>\n$ vagrant up\nBringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...\n[default] Importing base box 'CentOS 6.4 x86_64 Minimal'...\n[default] Matching MAC address for NAT networking...\n[default] Setting the name of the VM...\n[default] Clearing any previously set forwarded ports...\n[default] Fixed port collision for 22 => 2222.

Now wait, what if you wanted to start with nginx and not apache2? Easy, let's make a quick change. First we'll destroy the box we just created\n<pre>exit \nvagrant destroy -f</pre>\n\nThe -f will just make it do it, and give you the 'are you sure' message. Now edit the Cheffile found in the chef directory\n<pre>cd chef\nvi Cheffile</pre>\n\nchange apache2 to nginx so it will look like\n<code>cookbook 'nginx', '>= 1.0.0'</code>\n\nLet's tell librarian to get that cookbook\n<pre>$ librarian-chef update\nInstalling build-essential (1.4.2)\nInstalling apt (2.1.1)\nInstalling yum (2.3.2)\nInstalling runit (1.2.0)\nInstalling ohai (1.1.12)\nInstalling nginx (1.8.0)</pre>\n\nOk, it's installed other cookbooks that it thinks we might need, we won't need apt because we're rocking CentOS, but hey, that's cool. Also notice there is not an apache2 cookbook in the directory anymore, so it's cleaned up what we didn't need, nice!\n\nNow let's tell Vagrantfile about the change\n<pre>cd -\nvi Vagrantfile</pre>\n\nAnd just change where it says apache2 to nginx\n<code>chef.add_recipe \"nginx\"</code>\n\nand now kick off a build of that box\n<pre>vagrant up </pre>\n\nDo your verification as above, but notice we're not rocking nginx, as it should be. Whew, that was quick, but hey, it's something to build on, and I'll try to demonstrate that going forward by using this same setup to deploy to 'real' virtual machines in the future.

[download the latest version](http://www.fedora-commons.org/software) of Fedora-commons (my example uses wget, since that's how I roll, and is with the latest currently available version, modify as needed)\n\n\n    \n    wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/fedora-commons/fcrepo-installer-3.3.jar\n\n\n\t\n  2. create a filed called  'install30.properties' so you don't have to answer all the questions the installer asks.  Read through this example and modify as needed.\n\n\n    \n    # example install.properties\n    ri.enabled=true\n    messaging.enabled=true\n    apia.auth.required=false\n    database.jdbcDriverClass=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\n    ssl.available=false\n    database.jdbcURL=jdbc\\:mysql\\://localhost/fedora33?useUnicode\\=true&amp;characterEncoding\\=UTF-8&amp;autoReconnect\\=true\n    messaging.uri=vm\\:(broker\\:(tcp\\://localhost\\:61616))\n    database.password=secret\n    database.mysql.driver=included\n    database.username=root\n    tomcat.shutdown.port=8001\n    deploy.local.services=true\n    xacml.enabled=false\n    database.mysql.jdbcDriverClass=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\n    tomcat.http.port=8080\n    fedora.serverHost=localhost\n    database=mysql\n    database.driver=included\n    tomcat.home=/opt/fedora/tomcat\n    fedora.home=/opt/fedora\n    rest.enabled=true\n    install.type=custom\n    servlet.engine=included\n    fedora.admin.pass=fedoraAdmin\n\n\n\t\n  3. create a database as defined above (NOTE: this could be different for you, if you're not using a DB, enter database.jdbcDriverClass=com.mcoi.jdbc.Driver and remove the MySQL specfic lines)\n\n\n    \n    mysqladmin -h localhost -u root -p  create fedora33\n\n\n\t\n  4. then run the Fedora-commons installer, using the -jar switch with Java and calling out your properties file at the end\n\n\n    \n    /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/bin/java -jar fcrepo-installer-3.3.jar install.33.properties\n\n\n\n\n\t\n  1. to start Fedora-commons, define your FEDORA_HOME, JAVA_HOME, etc in your profile, or a simple BASH start script - here's an example, again modify as needed.\n\n\n    \n    # example start_fedora.sh\n    export JAVA_HOME=\"/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun\"\n    export FEDORA_HOME=\"/opt/fedora\"\n    export CATALINA_HOME=\"$FEDORA_HOME/tomcat\"\n    /opt/fedora/tomcat/bin/startup.sh\n\n\n\t\n  2. run the BASH script, watch for any errors\n\n\n    \n    ./start-fedora.sh\n\n\n\t\n  3. view the Fedora Admin within a web browser (change the URL to suit)\n\n\n    \n    http://localhost.domain.com:8080/fedora/search\n\n\n\t\n  4. later, learn how to [import stuff](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FCR30/Getting+Started+with+Fedora)\n\n\t\n  5. ???\n\n\t\n  6. Profit!\n\n\nThanks goes out to all at Fedora-commons, specifically those on the mailing list that walked me through the early steps and made that learning curve just a bit flatter.  I'm still planning on working on a Debian 'deb' installer to simplify the above process.  If you hit any questions or have issues with the above, leave a message below.\n\nThanks\n","updated":1414378977000,"excerpt":"<p><img src=\"http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/newlogo2.jpg\" alt=\"newlogo2\">So I’ve been using <a href=\"http://www.fedora-commons.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Fedora-commons</a> for almost a year, first off, no it is NOT the <a href=\"http://fedoraproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Linux distribution</a>, it is a digital repository used by libraries, museums, etc, worldwide to keep track of their digital collections.

Enjoy, and I’ll see some of you Saturday!</p>\n<p>As you should know by now, <a href=\"http://www.recordstoreday.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Record Store Day</a> (April 16, 2011) is rapid approaching, and to me it’s more of a holiday than most holidays. As a quick intro, their site states that, “<em>This is the one day that all of the independently owned record stores come together with artists to celebrate the art of music. Special vinyl and CD releases and various promotional products are made exclusively for the day and hundreds of artists in the United States and in various countries across the globe make special appearances and performances. Festivities include performances, cook-outs, body painting, meet &amp; greets with artists, parades, djs spinning records and on and on. […] Record Store Day is now celebrated the third Saturday every April.</em>“ As<a href=\"http://fak3r.com/commentary/record-store-day-april-18-2009/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\"> I’ve blogged about it</a>, <a href=\"http://fak3r.com/commentary/commerce/first-ever-record-store-day-rocked/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">each year</a>, <a href=\"http://fak3r.com/commentary/commerce/record-store-day-april-19-2008/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">since it started</a> - I wanted to do more this year, I wanted to promote Record Store Day to all the people in my neighborhood that might not appreciate the local record shop (<a href=\"http://www.euclidrecords.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Euclid Records</a>) that I’ve spent time in for over 25 years. To do this my thought was one of getting offline, ya, going analog, taking it to the streets as it were, so I checked with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/recordstoreday\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">@recordstoreday on Twitter</a> to see if they had any ready made posters I could print out…</p>\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n\n<p>[caption id=”attachment_2903” align=”aligncenter” width=”488” caption=”I confront RSD and, with fists raised, demand justice!”]<a href=\"http://fak3r.com/commentary/commerce/howto-make-a-diy-record-store-day-sign/attachment/rsd_twitter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\"><img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/12/files/rsd_twitter.png\" alt=\"fak3r confronts RSD and demands justice\"></a>[/caption]</p>\n<p>..and since they didn’t - my mind full of morning coffee starting cranking on the problem and quickly came up with an (almost) free DIY solution. One that would promote RSD and allow others to do the same, in their own way, or a new way, using my simple idea as a base (hmm…sounds like why I like open source software…but I digress, we’re talking about MUSIC in this post people!). I know of a few places online that you can upload an image and have it blown up so it can be printed across multiple pages that you can then piece together like a puzzle, but my favorite one is <a href=\"http://www.blockposters.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Block Posters</a>. Now I’m sure some crazy Photoshop people can do this better, and I hope they do, but I wanted to keep a free option for those that don’t have the chops and/or software to go that route. So, if ready for the challenge, here are the steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download a promotional Record Store Day image ready to print, I prefer <a href=\"http://recordstoreday.com/templates/Store/pretty_new/RSD2011logos/RSD2011DATE.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">this one</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit <a href=\"http://www.blockposters.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Block Posters</a>, choose your image and upload it by clicking ‘Continue’</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Decide how many pages you want your image sliced up in, and the overall layout. Notice that they list the overall size as you change the parameters which is muy, muy helpful. Once you are satisfied with the layout, click ‘Continue’ again.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Download and save your PDF, open it and print it. After that put it together, color it, distort it or otherwise make it your own.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Plaster it wherever (you have permission to) and repeat as necessary!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For people that are happy with the basic size of 2.8 feet wide by 2 feet high, I’ve saved a copy so as not to hammer the nice folks at Block Posters, it was created with the preferred JPG from above and these basic options…</p>\n<p>[caption id=”attachment_2908” align=”aligncenter” width=”493” caption=”Default settings make it 2.8 feet wide and 2 feet high”]<a href=\"http://fak3r.com/commentary/commerce/howto-make-a-diy-record-store-day-sign/attachment/rsd_bp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\"><img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/12/files/rsd_bp.png\" alt=\"Default settings make it 2.8 feet wide and 2 feet high\"></a>[/caption]</p>\n<p>and you can <a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/649440/BlockPosters-YourPoster-809.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">grab it here</a>.

To do this my thought was one of getting offline, ya, going analog, taking it to the streets as it were, so I checked with [@recordstoreday on Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/recordstoreday) to see if they had any ready made posters I could print out...\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2903\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"488\" caption=\"I confront RSD and, with fists raised, demand justice!\"][![fak3r confronts RSD and demands justice](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/12/files/rsd_twitter.png)](http://fak3r.com/commentary/commerce/howto-make-a-diy-record-store-day-sign/attachment/rsd_twitter/)[/caption]\n\n..and since they didn't - my mind full of morning coffee starting cranking on the problem and quickly came up with an (almost) free DIY solution. One that would promote RSD and allow others to do the same, in their own way, or a new way, using my simple idea as a base (hmm...sounds like why I like open source software...but I digress, we're talking about MUSIC in this post people!). I know of a few places online that you can upload an image and have it blown up so it can be printed across multiple pages that you can then piece together like a puzzle, but my favorite one is [Block Posters](http://www.blockposters.com/). Now I'm sure some crazy Photoshop people can do this better, and I hope they do, but I wanted to keep a free option for those that don't have the chops and/or software to go that route. So, if ready for the challenge, here are the steps:\n\n\n\n\t\n  1. Download a promotional Record Store Day image ready to print, I prefer [this one](http://recordstoreday.com/templates/Store/pretty_new/RSD2011logos/RSD2011DATE.jpg).\n\n\t\n  2. Visit [Block Posters](http://www.blockposters.com/), choose your image and upload it by clicking 'Continue'\n\n\t\n  3. Decide how many pages you want your image sliced up in, and the overall layout. Notice that they list the overall size as you change the parameters which is muy, muy helpful. Once you are satisfied with the layout, click 'Continue' again.\n\n\t\n  4. Download and save your PDF, open it and print it. After that put it together, color it, distort it or otherwise make it your own.\n\n\t\n  5. Plaster it wherever (you have permission to) and repeat as necessary!\n\n\nFor people that are happy with the basic size of 2.8 feet wide by 2 feet high, I've saved a copy so as not to hammer the nice folks at Block Posters, it was created with the preferred JPG from above and these basic options...\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2908\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"493\" caption=\"Default settings make it 2.8 feet wide and 2 feet high\"][![Default settings make it 2.8 feet wide and 2 feet high](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/12/files/rsd_bp.png)](http://fak3r.com/commentary/commerce/howto-make-a-diy-record-store-day-sign/attachment/rsd_bp/)[/caption]\n\nand you can [grab it here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/649440/BlockPosters-YourPoster-809.pdf).

Described on their website, ”<em>Symphony OS is a Desktop computer operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux and Knoppix GNU/Linux. Rather than using the KDE or Gnome Desktop environments as most Linux distributions do, the Symphony OS team has created the revolutionary <a href=\"http://www.symphonyos.com/mezzo.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Mezzo Desktop environment</a>. Symphony provides what we consider to be the easiest to use Linux experience there is</em>.” I really like their idea that, ”<em>Mezzo disposes of standard concepts like “The desktop is a folder</em>” and referring to it as a “junk drawer”. Whatever distros or OS I’m on (Linux, OS X, Winders) I <em>always</em> dump all of my desktop icons, and have since I figured out how to back in the Gnome 1.4 days! So while the distro is interesting, the real attraction is the new desktop environment, and how they’ve dealt with things differently. Another overview of what Symphony OS was born out of from <a href=\"http://www.squidoo.com/symphonyos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">this post</a> reads, ”<em>Symphony OS is a Linux-based operating system that attempts to correct what are percieved interface errors present in todays modern computing interfaces. It does so through an interface known as the Mezzo Desktop, integrating ideas from <a href=\"http://ei.cs.vt.edu/~cs5724/g1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Fitt’s Law</a>, as well as <a href=\"http://www.symphonyos.com/laws.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Jason Spisak’s Laws of Interface Design</a></em>.” Needless to say, this is far from just another distro, it addresses UI and useability issues that no other other UI has successfully improved upon; this is exciting. Looking at the screenshots it’s hard to see that too much is changed, but when you actually demo it you’ll get how the “Laws” referred to above are applied, and it’s very nice. Looking through the (now outdated) <a href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/jasonspisak/Mezzo/PhotoAlbum4.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Mezzo UI 1.0 Mockups</a> will give you a bit more into the feel for the look of the desktop. A novel approach is that although the window manager (somehow) uses FVWM, it’s also apparently served up via a local webserver, allowing for a desktop to support web apps, ala “Web 2.0” stuff like gmail, Flickr and the like. Think about how Konfabulator, OS X Widgets allowed for bits and pieces of the web to enter the desktop (RSS, weather, ebay searches) and then you’ll see how Mezzo’s approach can really opens things up in a way no other desktop every has, and I can see developers chomping at the bit on that one. Until now you’ve had to download/install their Symphony OS to play around with Mezzo, but now it’s available to use on Debian based distros, <a href=\"http://ubuntulinux.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Ubuntu Linux</a> included. Here I present the first HOWTO on installing Mezzo on Ubuntu. While they document this on their site, the docs are incomplete, thus I felt the need to share (and I will share them with them as well). I’ll update this as I learn how to add more to the desktop, it looks like this is going to be a fun alternative to the KDE/Gnome contingent, and I can’t wait for a 1.0.</p>\n<p>To install the Mezzo, and the requred Orchestra package, on Ubuntu Linux 5.10 (Breezy Badger) become root:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"title\">code</span>&gt;</span>su - root<span class=\"tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"title\">code</span>&gt;</span>\n</code></pre><p>Or if you don’t have a regular root account (as is the default in Ubuntu) do:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"title\">code</span>&gt;</span>sudo su -<span class=\"tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"title\">code</span>&gt;</span>\n</code></pre><p>And then enter your normal users’ password when prompted.</p>\n<p>Next add the following to you /etc/apt/sources.list:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;deb <span class=\"symbol\">http:</span>/<span class=\"regexp\">/archive.progeny.com/symphonyos</span><span class=\"regexp\">/apt/</span> ./&lt;<span class=\"regexp\">/code&gt;</span>\n</code></pre><p>Now update apt:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;apt-<span class=\"built_in\">get</span> <span class=\"keyword\">update</span>&lt;/code&gt;\n</code></pre><p>And then install Mezzo and Orchestra packages, with a couple of other needed deps:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"title\">code</span>&gt;</span>apt-get install mezzo orchestra libstdc++5 xdialog<span class=\"tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"title\">code</span>&gt;</span>\n</code></pre><p>(Optional) Install the <a href=\"http://www.metatheme.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">MetaTheme</a>, which is “…a project dedicated to unification of appearance between different graphics toolkits (currently GTK2, QT and Java).” According to Symphony OS creator, Ryan, ”<em>MetaTheme is in no way required. It makes things look pretty but that is about it</em>” Also, currently the bundled MetaTheme package is broken [<a href=\"http://www.symphonyos.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=662&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=3813\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">source</a>] so you should not install it via apt-get. Instead, either wait for an updated package, or do what I did; download the tarball and follow the manual install steps. MetaTheme needs the dev headers for libgtk2, which I didn’t have installed, so make sure you have those by using apt-get:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"title\">code</span>&gt;</span>apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev<span class=\"tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"title\">code</span>&gt;</span>\n</code></pre><p>Now get, configure, install and configure Metatheme:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"title\">code</span>&gt;</span>wget http://www.metatheme.org/download/metatheme-0.0.6.tar.bz2\ntar xvjf metatheme-0.0.6.tar.bz2\ncd metatheme-0.0.6\n./configure<span class=\"tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"title\">code</span>&gt;</span>\n</code></pre><p>Watch for errors, then make it:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"title\">code</span>&gt;</span>make<span class=\"tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"title\">code</span>&gt;</span>\n</code></pre><p>Finally install it:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"title\">code</span>&gt;</span>make install<span class=\"tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"title\">code</span>&gt;</span>\n</code></pre><p>Then back to your normal user (doesn’t sound right to me either, but…) to activate Metatheme in all supported toolkits:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"title\">code</span>&gt;</span>exit\nmetatheme-install<span class=\"tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"title\">code</span>&gt;</span>\n</code></pre><p>Now you have to restart your session, so logout of your Desktop Manager and come back in. Next run the ‘mt-config’ application as your normal user to configure Metatheme and choose your favorite theme:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"title\">code</span>&gt;</span>mt-config<span class=\"tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"title\">code</span>&gt;</span>\n</code></pre><p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: thanks to comments from Gabriele Tassoni below, here’s another step that is very important. You have to manually copy the .metatheme directory from your normal user’s home directory to root’s home.

Thanks Ryan.\n\n\n![250px-symph-032.png](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/250px-symph-032.png)\nSeeing a new Linux distro out there is kind of like seeing another cloud in the sky, but every now and then something comes along with a fresh idea or approach; enter [Symphony OS](http://www.symphonyos.com/). Described on their website, ”_Symphony OS is a Desktop computer operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux and Knoppix GNU/Linux. Rather than using the KDE or Gnome Desktop environments as most Linux distributions do, the Symphony OS team has created the revolutionary [Mezzo Desktop environment](http://www.symphonyos.com/mezzo.html). Symphony provides what we consider to be the easiest to use Linux experience there is_.” I really like their idea that, ”_Mezzo disposes of standard concepts like “The desktop is a folder_” and referring to it as a “junk drawer”. Whatever distros or OS I’m on (Linux, OS X, Winders) I _always_ dump all of my desktop icons, and have since I figured out how to back in the Gnome 1.4 days! So while the distro is interesting, the real attraction is the new desktop environment, and how they’ve dealt with things differently. Another overview of what Symphony OS was born out of from [this post](http://www.squidoo.com/symphonyos/) reads, ”_Symphony OS is a Linux-based operating system that attempts to correct what are percieved interface errors present in todays modern computing interfaces. It does so through an interface known as the Mezzo Desktop, integrating ideas from [Fitt’s Law](http://ei.cs.vt.edu/~cs5724/g1/), as well as [Jason Spisak’s Laws of Interface Design](http://www.symphonyos.com/laws.html)_.” Needless to say, this is far from just another distro, it addresses UI and useability issues that no other other UI has successfully improved upon; this is exciting. Looking at the screenshots it’s hard to see that too much is changed, but when you actually demo it you’ll get how the “Laws” referred to above are applied, and it’s very nice. Looking through the (now outdated) [Mezzo UI 1.0 Mockups](http://homepage.mac.com/jasonspisak/Mezzo/PhotoAlbum4.html) will give you a bit more into the feel for the look of the desktop. A novel approach is that although the window manager (somehow) uses FVWM, it’s also apparently served up via a local webserver, allowing for a desktop to support web apps, ala “Web 2.0” stuff like gmail, Flickr and the like. Think about how Konfabulator, OS X Widgets allowed for bits and pieces of the web to enter the desktop (RSS, weather, ebay searches) and then you’ll see how Mezzo’s approach can really opens things up in a way no other desktop every has, and I can see developers chomping at the bit on that one. Until now you’ve had to download/install their Symphony OS to play around with Mezzo, but now it’s available to use on Debian based distros, [Ubuntu Linux](http://ubuntulinux.org/) included. Here I present the first HOWTO on installing Mezzo on Ubuntu. While they document this on their site, the docs are incomplete, thus I felt the need to share (and I will share them with them as well). I’ll update this as I learn how to add more to the desktop, it looks like this is going to be a fun alternative to the KDE/Gnome contingent, and I can’t wait for a 1.0.\n\n\n\n\nTo install the Mezzo, and the requred Orchestra package, on Ubuntu Linux 5.10 (Breezy Badger) become root:\n\n    \n    <code>su - root</code>\n\n\nOr if you don’t have a regular root account (as is the default in Ubuntu) do:\n\n    \n    <code>sudo su -</code>\n\n\nAnd then enter your normal users’ password when prompted.\n\nNext add the following to you /etc/apt/sources.list:\n\n    \n    <code>deb http://archive.progeny.com/symphonyos/apt/ ./</code>\n\n\nNow update apt:\n\n    \n    <code>apt-get update</code>\n\n\nAnd then install Mezzo and Orchestra packages, with a couple of other needed deps:\n\n    \n    <code>apt-get install mezzo orchestra libstdc++5 xdialog</code>\n\n\n(Optional) Install the [MetaTheme](http://www.metatheme.org/), which is “…a project dedicated to unification of appearance between different graphics toolkits (currently GTK2, QT and Java).” According to Symphony OS creator, Ryan, ”_MetaTheme is in no way required. It makes things look pretty but that is about it_” Also, currently the bundled MetaTheme package is broken [[source](http://www.symphonyos.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=662&view=findpost&p=3813)] so you should not install it via apt-get. Instead, either wait for an updated package, or do what I did; download the tarball and follow the manual install steps. MetaTheme needs the dev headers for libgtk2, which I didn’t have installed, so make sure you have those by using apt-get:\n\n    \n    <code>apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev</code>\n\n\nNow get, configure, install and configure Metatheme:\n\n    \n    <code>wget http://www.metatheme.org/download/metatheme-0.0.6.tar.bz2\n    tar xvjf metatheme-0.0.6.tar.bz2\n    cd metatheme-0.0.6\n    ./configure</code>\n\n\nWatch for errors, then make it:\n\n    \n    <code>make</code>\n\n\nFinally install it:\n\n    \n    <code>make install</code>\n\n\nThen back to your normal user (doesn’t sound right to me either, but…) to activate Metatheme in all supported toolkits:\n\n    \n    <code>exit\n    metatheme-install</code>\n\n\nNow you have to restart your session, so logout of your Desktop Manager and come back in. Next run the ‘mt-config’ application as your normal user to configure Metatheme and choose your favorite theme:\n\n    \n    <code>mt-config</code>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**UPDATE**: thanks to comments from Gabriele Tassoni below, here’s another step that is very important. You have to manually copy the .metatheme directory from your normal user’s home directory to root’s home. Without doing this no GUI apps that need root/sudo privledges (Synaptic for Debian/Ubuntu users is a major one) will run! I’m going to email the MetaTheme devs about this to see if they can fix it for the next release. So, to avoid this pitfall:\n\n    \n    <code>sudo cp -R ~/.metatheme /root/.metatheme</code>\n\n\nNow, back to the Mezzo install, you need to copy the Mezzo and Orchestra settings and base desktop files to the home directory, so again as your regular user:\n\n    \n    <code>cp -Rvf /etc/skel/.mezzo ~/\n    cp -Rvf /etc/skel/.orchestra ~/\n    cp -Rvf /usr/share/fvwm/.fvwm2rc ~/.fvwm</code>\n\n\nOnce you’re back up and in your default desktop, logout, then from your GDM or KDM login manager, login as normal, but choose the Mezzo ‘Session’.\n\nIf GDM or KDM does not show Mezzo as an option, you may need to restart the login manager for it to find it (I didn’t need to do this, but Ryan pointed it out):\n\n    \n    <code>/etc/init.d/gdm restart</code>\n\n\nor\n\n    \n    <code>/etc/init.d/kdm restart</code>\n\n\nThat’s it, once in click in the corners to get aquinted and start playing around. I’ll post more about this as I learn it, I think it’s pretty cool at this stage.\n\n","updated":1414378977000,"excerpt":"","_id":"ghfw1ggu5tjpyqit","photos":[],"link":""},{"layout":"post","title":"HOWTO mine Bitcoin in Linux","date":1386547800000,"comments":true,"categories":["tqfuuo7473x8fpzz","a8m796gn7i2so43k","i27fwt0trxeaa696"],"content":"<p>I started mining <a href=\"http://bitcoin.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Bitcoin</a> back in August, and have had modest success (more in a later post), but when I was getting started I couldn’t find a good/current HOWTO; this post aimes to fix that.

Of course since I use <a href=\"http://mmonit.com/monit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">monit</a> I can see that the service was never restarted, plus I’ve never had this happen on other servers with monit, so I’m convinced that Tomcat, with its hunger for Java, is the culrprit here.

To start you want to install Tomcat, notice that since I’m running Lenny, it still uses Tomcat5.5.

Basically a lot. To just post messages now it seems far more complex than it once was.My original idea with this was to do it as low tech as possible so users wouldn’t have to install a ton of stuff and configure it - I wanted it to ‘just work’ easily. Now with OAuth it seems this will never work easily, first of all you have to ‘<a href=\"http://dev.twitter.com/apps/new\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">register an application</a>‘ for it to have access to OAuth - which seems crazy to me, we don’t want it to have access, just the ability to push a message to an account. Then if you look <a href=\"//apiwiki.twitter.com/OAuth-Examples\">there are libraries out there that <em>can</em> post</a>, but <a href=\"http://github.com/abraham/twitteroauth/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">look at the directions</a> for one of the libraries, it involves not only building the app and getting temporary access to the twitter API, then you also have to get the two keys from that and bake them into the app by recompiling it, and then more configuration, etc. So <strong>for now I am MARKING THIS IDEA AS DEAD</strong>. If I figure out a new way to do it that I can sketch out I will, or if anyone else has a simple way post it in the comments and I’ll update it here. Thanks for your interest and good luck!</p>\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The other day I got inspired to write a script that would allow me to monitor my servers via <a href=\"http://twitter.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Twitter</a>. The idea of having a column in <a href=\"http://www.tweetdeck.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Tweetdeck</a> set aside to inform me of my servers’ statuses’ sounded cool, plus, it’s quicker than checking email.

While hers was written in <a href=\"http://www.perl.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Perl</a>, I didn’t want to go that route since I had a few, self imposed, restrictions I wanted to stick to.  One, I only wanted to use standard shell commands, the ones you get by default in Linux, so you would have absolutely no dependencies to install for this to work.  Two, I wanted to see how much info I could stuff into a 140 character tweet, and still have it make sense.  While I’m still working on adding more info, the current state of the script gives me a quick snapshot of seven specifics metrics on a selected server, which I’m quite happy with.  To try it yourself only takes a few minutes.</p>\n<p>First you’ll need a Twitter account, either the one you already use, or a dedicated one that only your servers post to (this is what I’ve done).  For a tad bit more security I protected my tweets and made the account private - I don’t think I’ll get hacked by anyone that sees my system load is too high, but I’d rather not hear about it from security experts that I’m leaving myself open, so I’ll continue to keep things blocked by default.  Also, I’ve setup the update method to use <a href=\"http://www.openssl.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">SSL</a> to login and transmit, so you can rest a little easier knowing that things are staying encrypted while they move over the wire.  The only option I’ve coded in is that you can use <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">wget</a> (by default) or <a href=\"http://curl.haxx.se/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">curl</a> (not installed by default in any <a href=\"http://kernel.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Linux</a> distro I’m running, but is on <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">OS X</a> if someone wants it for that), so you have a little bit of flexibility if you need it.  Otherwise it’s pretty much ready to go out of the box, define your username and password at the top of the script, chmod it, and away we go.

First, we want to tell Linux that we want to know what’s going on, and not be given part of the picture. Let’s edit /etc/default/rcS (in <a href=\"http://www.debian.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Debian GNU/Linux</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Ubuntu Linux</a>) and see what it tells us:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"comment\">#</span>\n<span class=\"comment\"># /etc/default/rcS</span>\n<span class=\"comment\">#</span>\n<span class=\"comment\"># Default settings for the scripts in /etc/rcS.d/</span>\n<span class=\"comment\">#</span>\n<span class=\"comment\"># For information about these variables see the rcS(5) manual page.</span>\n<span class=\"comment\">#</span>\n<span class=\"comment\"># This file belongs to the \"initscripts\" package.</span>\n\n<span class=\"variable\">TMPTIME=</span><span class=\"number\">0</span>\n<span class=\"variable\">SULOGIN=</span>no\n<span class=\"variable\">DELAYLOGIN=</span>no\n<span class=\"variable\">UTC=</span>yes\n<span class=\"variable\">VERBOSE=</span>no\n<span class=\"variable\">FSCKFIX=</span>no\n</code></pre><p>What? Verbose=no? I don’t think so. Let’s edit that to read:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"setting\">VERBOSE=<span class=\"value\"><span class=\"keyword\">yes</span></span></span>\n</code></pre><p>Now we’re getting somewhere! Next up, <strong>we need to tell the bootloade</strong>r, in this case <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Grub</a>, to<strong> give us all the yummy text goodness that a growing body needs! </strong>For this we edit /boot/grub/menu.1st, you’ll want to scroll just past the line that reads:</p>\n<pre><code>## ## <span class=\"keyword\">End</span> <span class=\"keyword\">Default</span> <span class=\"keyword\">Options</span> ##\n</code></pre><p>Now, look at the first block after that, mine says:</p>\n<pre><code>title           Ubuntu <span class=\"number\">10.10</span>, kernel <span class=\"number\">2.6</span><span class=\"number\">.35</span>-<span class=\"number\">25</span>-generic-pae\nuuid            <span class=\"number\">53</span>af9894-<span class=\"number\">9f</span>d1-<span class=\"number\">45f</span>e-b102-<span class=\"number\">3</span>ad0134eace3\nkernel         /boot/vmlinuz-<span class=\"number\">2.6</span><span class=\"number\">.35</span>-<span class=\"number\">25</span>-generic-pae root=UUID=<span class=\"number\">53</span>af9894-<span class=\"number\">9f</span>d1-<span class=\"number\">45f</span>e-b102-<span class=\"number\">3</span>ad0134eace3 ro quiet splash\ninitrd          /boot/initrd.img-<span class=\"number\">2.6</span><span class=\"number\">.35</span>-<span class=\"number\">25</span>-generic-pae\nquiet\n</code></pre><p>And that’s the default kernel Linux is going to boot into if you don’t choose anything.

Ahh, **the way Linus intended, epic!** Oh, you don't see that? Instead you see some animated Linux distro logo or something as useless like a progress bar tracing across the screen? Uggh, I hate that, you don't know what's really going on behind the scenes, and **if Linux is anything, it's transparent**. So, let's get that fixed for you. Basically as Linux as 'matured', we've been forced to load and watch more animated boot 'splash' screens for branding, and to make Linux more user-friendly, or more likely, more Windows or Mac-like. This way new users won't run for the hills if they see something like:\n\n    \n    [      2.125987 ] scsi 0:0:0:0: Direct-Access        ATA       ST380815AS       3.CH PQ: 0 ANSI: 5\n    [      2.128065 ] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] 156301488 512-byte logical blocks: (80.0 GB/74.5 GiB)\n    [      2.128072 ] sd 0:0:0:0: Attached scsi generic sg0 type 0\n\n\nOh the horror, right? **WRONG!** If you're like me and you use Linux because you love it and want to know what it's doing all of the time, you can't get enough details like this. So, there are a few simple ways to reclaim the way  Linux shows the bootup details; because it's all still going on regardless of what eye-candy is hiding it. First, we want to tell Linux that we want to know what's going on, and not be given part of the picture. Let's edit /etc/default/rcS (in [Debian GNU/Linux](http://www.debian.org/) and [Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com/)) and see what it tells us:\n\n    \n    #\n    # /etc/default/rcS\n    #\n    # Default settings for the scripts in /etc/rcS.d/\n    #\n    # For information about these variables see the rcS(5) manual page.\n    #\n    # This file belongs to the \"initscripts\" package.\n    \n    TMPTIME=0\n    SULOGIN=no\n    DELAYLOGIN=no\n    UTC=yes\n    VERBOSE=no\n    FSCKFIX=no\n\n\nWhat? Verbose=no? I don't think so. Let's edit that to read:\n\n    \n    VERBOSE=yes\n\n\nNow we're getting somewhere! Next up, **we need to tell the bootloade**r, in this case [Grub](http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/), to** give us all the yummy text goodness that a growing body needs! **For this we edit /boot/grub/menu.1st, you'll want to scroll just past the line that reads:\n\n    \n    ## ## End Default Options ##\n\n\nNow, look at the first block after that, mine says:\n\n    \n    title           Ubuntu 10.10, kernel 2.6.35-25-generic-pae\n    uuid            53af9894-9fd1-45fe-b102-3ad0134eace3\n    kernel         /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.35-25-generic-pae root=UUID=53af9894-9fd1-45fe-b102-3ad0134eace3 ro quiet splash\n    initrd          /boot/initrd.img-2.6.35-25-generic-pae\n    quiet\n\n\nAnd that's the default kernel Linux is going to boot into if you don't choose anything. See the kernel line? We can already tell that the **commands like quiet and splash aren't going to get us what we need**, so we edit that to read something like:\n\n    \n    kernel         /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.35-25-generic-pae root=UUID=53af9894-9fd1-45fe-b102-3ad0134eace3 ro\n\n\nThen, since it's Linux and we have full control over what's going on, we can tell it how we want the text rendered; the color depth and the screen resolution. Basically it breaks down like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepth\n\n\n800×600\n\n\n1024×768\n\n\n1152×864\n\n\n1280×1024\n\n\n1600×1200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8 bit\n\n\nvga=771\n\n\nvga=773\n\n\nvga=353\n\n\nvga=775\n\n\nvga=796\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16 bit\n\n\nvga=788\n\n\nvga=791\n\n\nvga=355\n\n\nvga=794\n\n\nvga=798\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24 bit\n\n\nvga=789\n\n\nvga=792\n\n\n\n\nvga=795\n\n\nvga=799\n\n\n\n\nSo, a simple way to set the screen resolution for text display during boot is by adding the vga= option to the end of that kernel line.

It handles protocols POP2, POP3, RPOP, APOP, KPOP, all flavors of <a href=\"http://www.imap.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">IMAP</a>, ETRN, and ODMR. It can even support IPv6 and IPSEC. Considering how I don’t know all of those protocols I figure it can handle things.

It handles protocols POP2, POP3, RPOP, APOP, KPOP, all flavors of [IMAP](http://www.imap.org/), ETRN, and ODMR. It can even support IPv6 and IPSEC. Considering how I don't know all of those protocols I figure it can handle things. So on my server I install fetchmail, along with [procmail](http://www.procmail.org/), which will route the mail once I get it to my server.\n\n\n    \n    apt-get install fetchmail procmail\n\n\n\nNext up I define a fetchmailrc in my home directory (${HOME}/.fetchmailrc) to tell fetchmail what to do anytime I call it.\n\n\n    \n    set no bouncemail\n    defaults:\n      antispam -1 \n      batchlimit 100\n    poll mail.domain.com with protocol imap\n    user phil password ******* is phil\n    ssl\n    sslproto SSL3\n    fetchall\n    keep\n    no rewrite\n    mda \"/usr/bin/procmail -f %F -d %T\";\n\n\n\nSome quick notes here, most is self-explanatory, but 'poll' calls the remote server using the 'user' and 'password' from the next line, then 'is phil' refers to the local user on the server. Using 'ssl' tells it to use an encrptyed connection and 'sslproto' forces it to use version 3. Then things like 'fetchall' tells it to look at all the emails (seen and unseen), 'keep' just keeps an email on the server (just until we're sure things are working). The last line is where the magic happens, once it has the mail it calls procmail to talk to your default mail transport agent (Debian uses exim4, yours may be postfix). Speaking of this we now tell Procmail what we want done, while it can be used for filtering with all sorts of regex fun, I'm going to define a simple .procmailrc recipe to just pass all of the mail it gets on to another address.\n\n\n    \n    :0\n    * .*\n    {\n    \t:0 c\n    \t$DEFAULT\n    \n    \t:0 \n    \t!phil@mymainemail.com\n    }\n\n\n\nSo I'm taking the mail, making a copy of it locally, called by the 'c' just after the first :0, (just until I know things are all on the level) and then forwarding another one to my 'real' email. And that's it, now I setup my user's crontab like this\n\n\n    \n    */5 * * * * /usr/bin/fetchmail >/dev/null 2>&1\n\n\n\nso it will poll the IMAP server every 5 mins checking for new mail...and that's it.

When asked what Tor is it’s hard to not get too technical, so here I’ll defer to the official description, “<em>Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and state security known as traffic analysis. Tor was originally designed, implemented, and deployed as a third-generation <a href=\"http://www.onion-router.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">onion routing project of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory</a>. It was originally developed with the U.S. Navy in mind, for the primary purpose of protecting government communications. Today, it is used every day for a wide variety of purposes by normal people, the military, journalists, law enforcement officers, activists, and many others.</em>“ So <em>basically</em> it’s a network of routed proxies that allow a reasonable amount of privacy and anonymity for anyone online.

The 8 cores’ indexes are currently about 18Gig, so it’s no small undertaking to backup and move these suckers around, so we’re using KVM vitual machines as new slave nodes. I setup these up on a stock Debian Squeeze (6.0) install and read up on how to make a master/slave Solr replication work. Since version 1.4 Solr boasts built in replication, so any external rsync enabled scripts are no longer needed. For this you’ll need at least two Solr servers running, though my directions are in Debian, they’ll be indentical if you’re running Ubuntu, and the same, after the Tomcat home directory, on other Linux distros.

The only reason to look for a new one is that the wifi is G speed, and the network is only 10/100. Eventually newer, sleeker, and far faster routers, tempted me too much. After looking around I found the best bang for the buck, and then I found an online factory reconditioned version and the decision was made. I’m now running the <a href=\"http://www.netgear.com/home/products/wirelessrouters/high-performance/WNDR3700.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Netgear WNDR3700</a> (v1) N600 Wireless Dual Band Gigabit Router, and after playing around with the stock firmware, I installed <a href=\"http://www.dd-wrt.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">DD-WRT</a> on it, and couldn’t be happier with it. It looks and feels a bit more hardcore than Tomato, and unlocks all sorts of features of the hardware that the factory firmware blocked access to. But first let’s look at the router, it’s a shiny, thin, tall (if setup with the included stand) router with brighter than average lights that the rim of the router help reflect out, more blinky lights is always a plus in my book. It’s a dual-band Wireless-N router, it has simultaneous networks running on 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz which support supports A/B/G/N speeds, it has a 680 MHz MIPS 32-bit processor (for comparison the WRT54GL had a 200 Mhz proc), 64 Meg RAM (again, the WRT54GL had 16 Meg RAM), 5 Gigabit ethernet ports, a USB 2.0 port for external networked storage (or networked printer if you’re running DD-WRT), dynamic DNS, firewall, and expanded QoS settings to handle things like VPN and VoIP. So that’s about it, this is still one of the fastest routers out there, and big step up from where I was previously. I knew I wouldn’t need to reference much from it, but I pulled up the <a href=\"http://support.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/11645/kw/wndr3700%20v1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">FAQ</a> and grabbed the <a href=\"ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/WNDR3700/Documentation/SM/WNDR3700_SM_04JUN2010.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">manual in PDF</a> form. Since this was a refurb I didn’t expect it to have the latest firmware installed, and it didn’t, instead having some version 1.0.4, while the latest was 1.0.16. So I grabbed the <a href=\"http://support.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/19565\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">latest firmware</a> for it, and flashed away, after a few minutes it rebooted, and I had version 1.0.16.98dnsNA installed. Then the fun began!<br><a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"What_is_DD-WRT?\">What is DD-WRT?</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/2011/dd-logo.png\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\">On to <a href=\"http://dd-wrt.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">DD-WRT</a>, what is it? According to their site, “<i>DD-WRT is a Linux based alternative OpenSource firmware suitable for a great variety of WLAN routers and embedded systems. The main emphasis lies on providing the easiest possible handling while at the same time supporting a great number of functionalities within the framework of the respective hardware platform used.</i>“ So, instead of running the proprietary firmware that comes on the Netgear router, we want to run Linux, sounds good.</p>\n<h3 id=\"What_are_DD-WRT’s_advantages_over_the_stock_firmware?\">What are DD-WRT’s advantages over the stock firmware?</h3>\n<p>When you buy a piece of consumer electronics, you’re basically bound by the rules of the software (referred to here as firmware). So if you buy a router from Linksys/Cisco, Netgear, D-Link, or others, you’re bound to their software, which limits what will and will not function on that hardware. From their perspective it makes some sense, you respect their limitations, and they promise to help with your problems. Of course when I buy something, it’s mine, and if I wanted to jailbreak a phone, open a cable box (that says not to) or flash a 3rd party firmware on a router, that’s what I’ll do, partially for the adventure, and partially because I can. So what if it voids my warranty? If I can push the hardware to do more, it’s worth it for me. So that’s where DD-WRT steps in. DD-WRT will allow all sorts of new bells and whistles to play with, that the proprietary firmare can hide away until you buy the more expensive version of the same hardware! Ya, it happens. Plus, since you’re running Linux, you can use OpenSSH from just about any computer, login to the router and poke around. Want to add more software to it later? Sure. Want to setup some cronjobs? Go for it, the skys the limit</p>\n<h3 id=\"Downloading_the_correct_firmware_version\">Downloading the correct firmware version</h3>\n<p>Looking the site, it’s clear that the router is fully supported, but to find the latest/greatest builds, you have to go through the <a href=\"https://secure.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">DD-WRT forums</a>. No big deal, it’s just that with so much hardware to support, latest versions are updated frequently, so finding the right fit is it a bit of a guessing game, until you do some research on the forums. I found the right sequence of steps, so let’s get started!</p>\n<p>From the forum, the post <a href=\"https://secure.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=144665&amp;highlight=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">WNDR3700 Info is conflicting and fragmented</a> gives us what we need to know. jblack says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Several people have reported the 17201 semi-bricking their router from an initial flash, but indicated if they flash build 16785, they could then use the “webflash” to update to 17201.<br>16785 can be found here: <a href=\"ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/others/eko/BrainSlayer-V24-preSP2/2011/04-09-11-r16785/netgear-wndr3700/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/others/eko/BrainSlayer-V24-preSP2/2011/04-09-11-r16785/netgear-wndr3700/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Use the one ending in NA if you are in North America.</p>\n<p>So, visit <a href=\"ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/others/eko/BrainSlayer-V24-preSP2/2011/04-09-11-r16785/netgear-wndr3700/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/others/eko/BrainSlayer-V24-preSP2/2011/04-09-11-r16785/netgear-wndr3700/</a> in a browser, and find the ‘NA’ version, which is netgear-wndr3700-factory_NA.img</p>\n<p>Download it with curl:</p>\n<pre><code>curl -<span class=\"constant\">O</span> <span class=\"symbol\">ftp:</span>/<span class=\"regexp\">/ftp.dd-wrt.com/others</span><span class=\"regexp\">/eko/</span><span class=\"constant\">BrainSlayer</span>-<span class=\"constant\">V24</span>-preSP2/<span class=\"number\">2011</span>/<span class=\"number\">04</span>-09-<span class=\"number\">11</span>-r16785/netgear-wndr370<span class=\"number\">0</span>/wndr370<span class=\"number\">0</span>-factory_NA.img\n</code></pre><p>…or wget:</p>\n<pre><code>wget <span class=\"symbol\">ftp:</span>/<span class=\"regexp\">/ftp.dd-wrt.com/others</span><span class=\"regexp\">/eko/</span><span class=\"constant\">BrainSlayer</span>-<span class=\"constant\">V24</span>-preSP2/<span class=\"number\">2011</span>/<span class=\"number\">04</span>-09-<span class=\"number\">11</span>-r16785/netgear-wndr370<span class=\"number\">0</span>/wndr370<span class=\"number\">0</span>-factory_NA.img\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"Upload_the_DD-WRT_firmware_to_your_router\">Upload the DD-WRT firmware to your router</h3>\n<p>Now, plug a cat5 cable directly into one of the ports on the router, and the other on a system - I usually use a laptop. Turn off wifi and make sure you can get an IP via DHCP from the router. Then, in a browser, navigate to the Netgear web console, usually at <a href=\"http://192.168.1.1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://192.168.1.1</a> (default login is admin:netgear) and choose Maintenance &gt; Router Upgrade</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"/assets/2011/router-upgrade.png\" border=\"0\"></div>\n\n<p>On the Router Upgrade page, click Browse, navigate to the firmware file wndr3700-factory_NA.img, click OK and finally Upload</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"/assets/2011/choose-image.png\" border=\"0\"></div>\n\n<p>At this point just be patient, go get a snack, and let the hardware and software do their thing. Do not get impatient and turn anything off, if you do, you might break the process (which isn’t always the end of the world, as we’ll find out later)</p>\n<h3 id=\"I_KAN_HAZ_SUCCESS?\">I KAN HAZ SUCCESS?</h3>\n<p>If all went according to plan, your router will have rebooted, and when you refresh your web browser you should be prompted to change your admin username and password, which is an excellent first step for the new firmware! After doing that you’ll end up with a page that looks something like this: </p>\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"/assets/2011/dd-wrt-starter_thumb.png\" border=\"0\"></div>\n\n<p>See all those tabs, Setup, Wireless, Services, Security, etc…these are all available for you to explore as you setup your new wifi router. Once you have the basics setup so it can function with your ISP, you can put it to work protecting your network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Not_successful,_or_even…_bricked?\">Not successful, or even… bricked?</h3>\n<p>What if something went wrong? You turned it off while you were flashing it, or like me, tried to update it to the next version while it was still plugged into your laptop, so it still didn’t have internet connectivity? Ya, it happens, as it did to me, since I can rarely leave well enough alone! If you go by normal internet posts they’ll say to hold down the ‘RESET’ button on the back, power it back on and see if it works. If it doesn’t they’ll say it’s ruined, and there’s no way to get it back. Of course once again the DD-WRT forums show us the way! A post from user Kyledoo titled <a href=\"https://secure.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=145602&amp;highlight=wndr3700\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Atheros WiSOC based Hardware</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Did you put the router into recovery mode? Turn off the router with the power button, insert paper clip into reset hole, hold while turning on the router, hold for at least 45 seconds (I waited until the power light started blinking GREEN).

Now, using the small object of your choice, press and hold the “Restore Factory Settings”, also known as the Reset button located on the bottom of the router (there is a red ring around it). While holding the rest button, turn the router back on.

The only reason to look for a new one is that the wifi is G speed, and the network is only 10/100. Eventually newer, sleeker, and far faster routers, tempted me too much. After looking around I found the best bang for the buck, and then I found an online factory reconditioned version and the decision was made. I'm now running the [Netgear WNDR3700](http://www.netgear.com/home/products/wirelessrouters/high-performance/WNDR3700.aspx) (v1) N600 Wireless Dual Band Gigabit Router, and after playing around with the stock firmware, I installed [DD-WRT](http://www.dd-wrt.com/) on it, and couldn't be happier with it. It looks and feels a bit more hardcore than Tomato, and unlocks all sorts of features of the hardware that the factory firmware blocked access to. But first let's look at the router, it's a shiny, thin, tall (if setup with the included stand) router with brighter than average lights that the rim of the router help reflect out, more blinky lights is always a plus in my book. It's a dual-band Wireless-N router, it has simultaneous networks running on 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz which support supports A/B/G/N speeds, it has a 680 MHz MIPS 32-bit processor (for comparison the WRT54GL had a 200 Mhz proc), 64 Meg RAM (again, the WRT54GL had 16 Meg RAM), 5 Gigabit ethernet ports, a USB 2.0 port for external networked storage (or networked printer if you're running DD-WRT), dynamic DNS, firewall, and expanded QoS settings to handle things like VPN and VoIP. So that's about it, this is still one of the fastest routers out there, and big step up from where I was previously. I knew I wouldn't need to reference much from it, but I pulled up the [FAQ](http://support.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/11645/kw/wndr3700%20v1) and grabbed the [manual in PDF](ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/WNDR3700/Documentation/SM/WNDR3700_SM_04JUN2010.pdf) form. Since this was a refurb I didn't expect it to have the latest firmware installed, and it didn't, instead having some version 1.0.4, while the latest was 1.0.16. So I grabbed the [latest firmware](http://support.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/19565) for it, and flashed away, after a few minutes it rebooted, and I had version 1.0.16.98dnsNA installed. Then the fun began! \n<!-- more -->\n\n\n### What is DD-WRT?\n\n<img src=\"/assets/2011/dd-logo.png\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\">On to [DD-WRT](http://dd-wrt.com/), what is it? According to their site, \"<i>DD-WRT is a Linux based alternative OpenSource firmware suitable for a great variety of WLAN routers and embedded systems. The main emphasis lies on providing the easiest possible handling while at the same time supporting a great number of functionalities within the framework of the respective hardware platform used.</i>\" So, instead of running the proprietary firmware that comes on the Netgear router, we want to run Linux, sounds good.\n\n### What are DD-WRT's advantages over the stock firmware?\n\n\nWhen you buy a piece of consumer electronics, you're basically bound by the rules of the software (referred to here as firmware). So if you buy a router from Linksys/Cisco, Netgear, D-Link, or others, you’re bound to their software, which limits what will and will not function on that hardware. From their perspective it makes some sense, you respect their limitations, and they promise to help with your problems. Of course when I buy something, it's mine, and if I wanted to jailbreak a phone, open a cable box (that says not to) or flash a 3rd party firmware on a router, that's what I'll do, partially for the adventure, and partially because I can. So what if it voids my warranty? If I can push the hardware to do more, it's worth it for me. So that’s where DD-WRT steps in. DD-WRT will allow all sorts of new bells and whistles to play with, that the proprietary firmare can hide away until you buy the more expensive version of the same hardware! Ya, it happens. Plus, since you're running Linux, you can use OpenSSH from just about any computer, login to the router and poke around. Want to add more software to it later? Sure. Want to setup some cronjobs? Go for it, the skys the limit\n\n\n### Downloading the correct firmware version\n\n\nLooking the site, it's clear that the router is fully supported, but to find the latest/greatest builds, you have to go through the [DD-WRT forums](https://secure.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/). No big deal, it's just that with so much hardware to support, latest versions are updated frequently, so finding the right fit is it a bit of a guessing game, until you do some research on the forums. I found the right sequence of steps, so let's get started!\n\nFrom the forum, the post [WNDR3700 Info is conflicting and fragmented](https://secure.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=144665&highlight=) gives us what we need to know. jblack says\n\n\n> Several people have reported the 17201 semi-bricking their router from an initial flash, but indicated if they flash build 16785, they could then use the \"webflash\" to update to 17201.\n16785 can be found here: [ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/others/eko/BrainSlayer-V24-preSP2/2011/04-09-11-r16785/netgear-wndr3700/](ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/others/eko/BrainSlayer-V24-preSP2/2011/04-09-11-r16785/netgear-wndr3700/)\n\nUse the one ending in NA if you are in North America.\n\n\nSo, visit [ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/others/eko/BrainSlayer-V24-preSP2/2011/04-09-11-r16785/netgear-wndr3700/](ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/others/eko/BrainSlayer-V24-preSP2/2011/04-09-11-r16785/netgear-wndr3700/  ) in a browser, and find the 'NA' version, which is netgear-wndr3700-factory_NA.img\n\nDownload it with curl:\n\n    \n    curl -O ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/others/eko/BrainSlayer-V24-preSP2/2011/04-09-11-r16785/netgear-wndr3700/wndr3700-factory_NA.img\n\n\n...or wget:\n\n    \n    wget ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/others/eko/BrainSlayer-V24-preSP2/2011/04-09-11-r16785/netgear-wndr3700/wndr3700-factory_NA.img\n\n\n\n\n### Upload the DD-WRT firmware to your router\n\n\nNow, plug a cat5 cable directly into one of the ports on the router, and the other on a system - I usually use a laptop. Turn off wifi and make sure you can get an IP via DHCP from the router. Then, in a browser, navigate to the Netgear web console, usually at http://192.168.1.1 (default login is admin:netgear) and choose Maintenance > Router Upgrade\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"/assets/2011/router-upgrade.png\" border=\"0\"></div>\n\nOn the Router Upgrade page, click Browse, navigate to the firmware file wndr3700-factory_NA.img, click OK and finally Upload\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"/assets/2011/choose-image.png\" border=\"0\"></div>\n\nAt this point just be patient, go get a snack, and let the hardware and software do their thing. Do not get impatient and turn anything off, if you do, you might break the process (which isn't always the end of the world, as we'll find out later)\n\n\n### I KAN HAZ SUCCESS?\n\n\nIf all went according to plan, your router will have rebooted, and when you refresh your web browser you should be prompted to change your admin username and password, which is an excellent first step for the new firmware! After doing that you'll end up with a page that looks something like this: \n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"/assets/2011/dd-wrt-starter_thumb.png\" border=\"0\"></div>\n\nSee all those tabs, Setup, Wireless, Services, Security, etc...these are all available for you to explore as you setup your new wifi router. Once you have the basics setup so it can function with your ISP, you can put it to work protecting your network.\n\n\n### Not successful, or even... bricked?\n\n\nWhat if something went wrong? You turned it off while you were flashing it, or like me, tried to update it to the next version while it was still plugged into your laptop, so it still didn't have internet connectivity? Ya, it happens, as it did to me, since I can rarely leave well enough alone! If you go by normal internet posts they'll say to hold down the 'RESET' button on the back, power it back on and see if it works. If it doesn't they'll say it's ruined, and there's no way to get it back. Of course once again the DD-WRT forums show us the way! A post from user Kyledoo titled [Atheros WiSOC based Hardware](https://secure.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=145602&highlight=wndr3700):\n\n\n> Did you put the router into recovery mode? Turn off the router with the power button, insert paper clip into reset hole, hold while turning on the router, hold for at least 45 seconds (I waited until the power light started blinking GREEN). This sucessfully unbricked my router, and I could then use tftp to flash the firmware onto it (I flashed dd-wrt build 16785)\n\nAdditional Information can be found here:\n\n[http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=79802](http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=79802)\n\n\nFollowing the steps found on [http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=79802](http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=79802) tells you how to download the latest firmware from Netgear (yes, going back to the proprietary one so your router will be 'like new' again). Hit this URL:  [http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/14244](http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/14244)\n\nFind the download button and grab the latest. Now you need to assign your system a static IP:\n\n    \n    IP address: 192.168.1.2\n    Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0\n    Default gateway: <leave blank>\n    Preferred DNS server: <leave blank>\n    Alternate DNS server: <leave blank>\n\n\nHow to put your router in 'Recovery mode':\n\n\n> Start by turning off the router using the power button on the back of the device. Now, using the small object of your choice, press and hold the \"Restore Factory Settings\", also known as the Reset button located on the bottom of the router (there is a red ring around it). While holding the rest button, turn the router back on. Continue to hold the reset button for approximately 45 seconds then release it.\n\n\nand finally, how to use tftp (a small commandline ftp client present in Windows, Mac and Linux) that will copy the firmware to the router and initiate the recovery.\n\n    \n    tftp -i 192.168.1.1 put WNDR3700-V1.0.4.68NA.img\n\n\nAfter this you do, you'll do the wait around game again, this time longer than before, but once it's rebooted and all the lights come back on, you'll see that you have the stock firmware installed, the router works, and is ready for you to try to install DD-WRT again.\n\n\n### The Loopback problem\n\n\nSo the only problem I had after getting this router up and running was to have it do the normal loopback for me. So if I was in on my network and I wanted to hit [http://fak3r.com](http://fak3r.com) it would bounce me right back to the server, instead of going out into the wild internet. Apparently this is a known issue, with a [user proposed fix](http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=89353&highlight=local) that works!\n\n\n> NAT Loopback fix for 15760 and higher, (Port forward issue) ... Save the following commands to the Firewall Script on the Administration->Commands\n\n\n\n    \n    insmod ipt_mark\n    insmod xt_mark\n    iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -i ! `get_wanface` -d `nvram get wan_ipaddr` -j MARK --set-mark 0xd001\n    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -m mark --mark 0xd001 -j MASQUERADE\n\n\n\n\n### Parting shot\n\n\nThis is an awesome router, and DD-WRT seems to fit it like a glove. After running this setup for 3 weeks I'm completely sold on it. I'm not even going to mention it being 'rock solid' or 'always available', because it's running Linux, so it goes without saying.

Our server runs <a href=\"http://tomcat.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Tomcat</a>, which I didn’t want to be public facing.  Because of this I proxy Tomcat requests through <a href=\"http://httpd.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Apache</a> with the use of <a href=\"http://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc-archive/jk2/common/AJPv13.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">ajp_proxy</a>, the successor to the old mod_jk.  Initially I was using <a href=\"http://nginx.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">nginx</a> in place of Apache, but after reading about all the functionality and performance improvements ajp_proxy offered, it was a no brainier; this is how to present Tomcat in a production environment.</p>\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n\n\n<p><strong>Security</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>First and foremost, I don’t believe Tomcat should directly serve the internet, from how I’ve used it in the past, and how I see it today, that is not its strong point.  It’s a great servlet engine and is very flexible for development; so let’s only expose that part to a proxy to be shown online.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Apache is an excellent webserver, but when configured properly it’s a fine dynamic proxy that can safely deliver data from other down stream services.  It’s with this that I used a combination of Apache modules to allow data from Tomcat to be online.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Apache’s configuration is also a key aspect to its security.  Too often modules are enabled ‘by default’ which makes running a Linux/Apache server easy, but this is the wrong way to approach it.  Fortunately the Debian developers know this and have packaged Apache so that when it’s installed, only the modules required to get the server running are enabled.  This way you only enable what you need, keeping exposure to the elements at a minimum.  mod_proxy, ajp_proxy - the first module allows Apache to act as a proxy, the second optimizes the way it talks to Tomcat and handles things like open connections, reusing existing connections and so on.  It’s basically a manager providing a far more robust solution than just Apache talking to Tomcat alone.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Lastly there’s Varnish (which we’ll talk more about next) serving up data in front of Apache; this allows us many options, but the one in this category, security, is that it can stop bots and junk traffic, when it hits the server; thus this kind of noise doesn’t get down to Apache, further isolating Apache from being exposing it to harmful or malicious traffic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Caching for performance and scalability</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I’ve worked with many caching/<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">reverse proxy</a> solutions over the years, and saw the potential to really improve djatoka’s performance with various levels of cache.  Reading online about scalability, many leading sites boast of using 3-5 layers of ‘cascading caching’ to provide greater performance out of the same hardware had they not gone that route.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Varnish is a relatively newcomer to the scene and bills itself as an HTTP accelerator.  I’ve had the opportunity to test Varnish head to head against the long time standard reverse proxy, <a href=\"http://www.squid-cache.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Squid</a>, in a true production environment.  With minimal configuration it’s clear, Varnish is much, much faster.  Even when things aren’t ideal (such as with our dealing with 1000s of tiles that may/may not be reused in the time they’re in the cache) it’s still a great improvement, while being a much lighter solution for the server with far greater features that allow great flexibility for future expansion.  In this situation it takes the brunt of the traffic away from Apache, so if Varnish can handle the request for an object, Apache doesn’t have to be bothered, increasing its ability to serve a greater amount of traffic.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The following diagram shows my real world test utilizing a site that contained mainly static HTML and images.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/varnish-graph1.gif\" alt=\"varnish-graph1\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The next level down is Apache, which includes the modules disk_cache, file_cache and mem_cache.  Utilizing these modules allows Apache to keep it’s own reserve of frequently used objects which it can query against when it gets a request, taking the load this time off of Tomcat.  If Apache has an object it serves it up, and doesn’t need to tax Tomcat, allowing Tomcat to take on greater load.  Also, to improve Apache performance there’s no reason not to enable mod_deflate, the replacement for the old mod_gzip, which handles zipping files before being served, reducing the file size the client has to receive.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Lastly we have djatoka which handles its own stable of cache via Tomcat’s temp directory.  At last check it had more than 20,000 image tiles and jpeg2000 files it had to choose from when a request comes in.  Of course if it doesn’t have it in cache it can generate the image itself, then after serving it, deposits it in its own cache for future requests.  Size of the cache directory can be set within the djatoka configuration.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>In the following diagram you can see the multiple levels of caching, and the path a request takes through the system</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.gliffy.com/publish/1587073/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\"><img src=\"http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/diagram2-1024x617.png\" alt=\"diagram2\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.gliffy.com/publish/1587073/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Click for larger image</a></p>\n<p><strong>Fault tolerance</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Currently I have Varnish handling the front end on port 81, so all traffic requesting images goes there first.  After comparing the request to its own cache, it will pass that request to on to Apache, but before doing that it checks Apache’s health.  This way if Apache were to go down it would seamlessly serve the request to it’s secondary backend instead, which in this case is Tomcat, bypassing an otherwise blocking service.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>We also use the monitoring software <a href=\"http://mmonit.com/monit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">monit</a>, a server solution I’ve used for years, and can’t recommend enough.  Monit’s sole purpose is watch the server, check processes, restart a process if it stops, kill/restart a process if it takes up too much resources, as well as do trivial things like check available disk space, report if file permissions have changed, and other server duties usually relegated to an admin.

Chris Freeland and Chris Moyers cover the background in far more detail on the [BHL Blog](http://biodiversitylibrary.blogspot.com/2009/01/now-serving-all-page-images-via-djatoka.html), so here I'll cover my rationale and decisions I made to provide a scalable, stable infrastructure to provide the images as efficiently as possible.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I started sketching out how I wanted to run djatoka, I knew I wanted it to provide security, caching for performance and scalability and fault tolerance.  Our server runs [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/), which I didn't want to be public facing.  Because of this I proxy Tomcat requests through [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/) with the use of [ajp_proxy](http://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc-archive/jk2/common/AJPv13.html), the successor to the old mod_jk.  Initially I was using [nginx](http://nginx.org) in place of Apache, but after reading about all the functionality and performance improvements ajp_proxy offered, it was a no brainier; this is how to present Tomcat in a production environment.\n\n\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n\n**Security**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n  * First and foremost, I don't believe Tomcat should directly serve the internet, from how I've used it in the past, and how I see it today, that is not its strong point.  It's a great servlet engine and is very flexible for development; so let's only expose that part to a proxy to be shown online.\n\n\t\n  * Apache is an excellent webserver, but when configured properly it's a fine dynamic proxy that can safely deliver data from other down stream services.  It's with this that I used a combination of Apache modules to allow data from Tomcat to be online.\n\n\t\n  * Apache's configuration is also a key aspect to its security.  Too often modules are enabled 'by default' which makes running a Linux/Apache server easy, but this is the wrong way to approach it.  Fortunately the Debian developers know this and have packaged Apache so that when it's installed, only the modules required to get the server running are enabled.  This way you only enable what you need, keeping exposure to the elements at a minimum.  mod_proxy, ajp_proxy - the first module allows Apache to act as a proxy, the second optimizes the way it talks to Tomcat and handles things like open connections, reusing existing connections and so on.  It's basically a manager providing a far more robust solution than just Apache talking to Tomcat alone.\n\n\t\n  * Lastly there's Varnish (which we'll talk more about next) serving up data in front of Apache; this allows us many options, but the one in this category, security, is that it can stop bots and junk traffic, when it hits the server; thus this kind of noise doesn't get down to Apache, further isolating Apache from being exposing it to harmful or malicious traffic.\n\n\n\n\n**Caching for performance and scalability**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n  * I've worked with many caching/[reverse proxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) solutions over the years, and saw the potential to really improve djatoka's performance with various levels of cache.  Reading online about scalability, many leading sites boast of using 3-5 layers of 'cascading caching' to provide greater performance out of the same hardware had they not gone that route.\n\n\t\n  * Varnish is a relatively newcomer to the scene and bills itself as an HTTP accelerator.  I've had the opportunity to test Varnish head to head against the long time standard reverse proxy, [Squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/), in a true production environment.  With minimal configuration it's clear, Varnish is much, much faster.  Even when things aren't ideal (such as with our dealing with 1000s of tiles that may/may not be reused in the time they're in the cache) it's still a great improvement, while being a much lighter solution for the server with far greater features that allow great flexibility for future expansion.  In this situation it takes the brunt of the traffic away from Apache, so if Varnish can handle the request for an object, Apache doesn't have to be bothered, increasing its ability to serve a greater amount of traffic.\n\n\t\n  * The following diagram shows my real world test utilizing a site that contained mainly static HTML and images.\n\n\n\n\n![varnish-graph1](http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/varnish-graph1.gif)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n  * The next level down is Apache, which includes the modules disk_cache, file_cache and mem_cache.  Utilizing these modules allows Apache to keep it's own reserve of frequently used objects which it can query against when it gets a request, taking the load this time off of Tomcat.  If Apache has an object it serves it up, and doesn't need to tax Tomcat, allowing Tomcat to take on greater load.  Also, to improve Apache performance there's no reason not to enable mod_deflate, the replacement for the old mod_gzip, which handles zipping files before being served, reducing the file size the client has to receive.\n\n\t\n  * Lastly we have djatoka which handles its own stable of cache via Tomcat's temp directory.  At last check it had more than 20,000 image tiles and jpeg2000 files it had to choose from when a request comes in.  Of course if it doesn't have it in cache it can generate the image itself, then after serving it, deposits it in its own cache for future requests.  Size of the cache directory can be set within the djatoka configuration.\n\n\t\n  * In the following diagram you can see the multiple levels of caching, and the path a request takes through the system\n\n\n\n\n[![diagram2](http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/diagram2-1024x617.png)](http://www.gliffy.com/publish/1587073/)\n\n\n\n\n[Click for larger image](http://www.gliffy.com/publish/1587073/)\n\n\n\n\n**Fault tolerance**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n  * Currently I have Varnish handling the front end on port 81, so all traffic requesting images goes there first.  After comparing the request to its own cache, it will pass that request to on to Apache, but before doing that it checks Apache's health.  This way if Apache were to go down it would seamlessly serve the request to it's secondary backend instead, which in this case is Tomcat, bypassing an otherwise blocking service.\n\n\t\n  * We also use the monitoring software [monit](http://mmonit.com/monit/), a server solution I've used for years, and can't recommend enough.  Monit's sole purpose is watch the server, check processes, restart a process if it stops, kill/restart a process if it takes up too much resources, as well as do trivial things like check available disk space, report if file permissions have changed, and other server duties usually relegated to an admin.  The great thing about monit is that once configured it just runs in the background, the only time I hear from it is if it takes action, or notices a change.  Once one of parameters tripped monit, it promptly emails me details of what it's found.  Of course it's trivial to set up monit to also alert a mobile device, a mailing list, or a team of admins.\n\n\n\n\n**Roadmap / Code / Enhancements**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n  * For future enhancements, our roadmap will always be [publicly viewable](http://www.mobot.org/gemini/Issues.aspx?pi=8&m=1), suggestions and feedback is always welcome.\n\n\t\n  * I post all of my code on my [github page](http://github.com/philcryer), which includes my auto installer for djatoka, and any improvements to djatoka that I create will be exposed there as well.\n\n\t\n  * Lastly, I will be revisiting fault tolerance over the next two weeks, as it's not acceptable to have a single point of failure in our chain of services.  Some of the things to be addressed will be backup services, backup servers and proxies with load balancing and health checking.  These steps will be covered in a future posting.\n\n\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\n\n\n\nWe're very excited to be one of the early adopters of djatoka, and thus far are very encouraged by it's ability and stability.  We now have a secure solution with multiple layers of defense against hostile traffic, our scaling problems are now a thing of the past, with caching and fault tolerance allowing multiple,flexible paths as we look to expand our operations.

I knew there was a way I could use [GNU Screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) (one of my favorite 'must have' sys admin tools) to do this, but it took me some time searching to find the right syntax to translate for my needs, so I'm posting it here.\n\n\n\n\n`﻿su - phil -c \"/usr/bin/screen -dmS solr /opt/start_solr141.sh\"`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's look at what's happening here, first we use `su` to run this as a different user, then we define the user (phil), then in the command, called out by the -c and encased in double quotes, using the screen command with -smS to start a new detached session, giving it a name, and finally giving it a command to run in that detached screen session. Now put this line in something like /etc/rc.local, and it will run that command, in a detached screen session, automatically on boot. In this case a shell script to kick off the [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) process in a detached screen session that you can attach to later. Yes, I could have written a 'real' start-up script and made it into an init.d file, and I know you can run Solr under [Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/), and I do, on production, but with test and development versions it's nice to be able to just spin new ones up quickly like this. Plus you can use the above line to start anything in a screen at boot, which is all I wanted to show in this example.

The 2.14 version of Gnome sports a [much faster gnome-terminal](http://www.gnome.org/start/2.14/notes/en/rnusers.html); it beats xterm for display by allot, and log startup is 20x faster than before!  Wow, they did some work on tuning there!\n\n\nOk, this is a cheap HOWTO seeing as how I just found it, cut/pasted it and restarted X - but hey, it rocks.  I’ve always used Gnome-terminal when in [Gnome](http://gnome.org/), but I also tend to when I’m in [Openbox](http://icculus.org/openbox/) or [Xfce](http://www.xfce.org/) I use it since I can control the fonts to make it usable, unlike xterm.  Last night after installing Xfce4 (recommended) on my iBook I hit their FAQ to do some tweaking where I came across [this](http://www.xfce.org/various/Xresources.txt), and now I can use xterm!

I was getting around to installing it at home, but it became more urgent when Varnish went down last week; without it running there’s nothing to handle requests on :80, so as a webserver it’s dead.

So here's my monitrc for the webserver Lighttpd fronted by Varnish, acting in the reverse proxy/http accel role. Varn is listening on 80, then, if things aren't cached, it forwards things on to Lighttpd listening on 82.

How about if it uses 50% of system memory in 5 cycles (cycles are checks, 120 seconds by default)?  Yep, it’ll take care of that.  How about watching a file and stopping a service and/or issuing an alert by email or web if the file’s UID, permission, or whatever has changed?   No problem.  Disk space is greater than 90% on one partition you want an email to go out to the admin?  Easy.

First in monitrc we list a global email address for the systems admin to get alerts:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"keyword\">set</span> alert sysop@fak3r.<span class=\"keyword\">com</span>\n</code></pre><p>Then, in the new include file, telling monit to watch a site is simple, for example:</p>\n<pre><code>check host fak3r.com <span class=\"operator\">with</span> address fak3r.com\n<span class=\"keyword\">if</span> failed url <span class=\"keyword\">http</span>://fak3r.com\ntimeout <span class=\"number\">10</span> <span class=\"built_in\">seconds</span> <span class=\"keyword\">for</span> <span class=\"number\">1</span> cycles <span class=\"keyword\">then</span> alert\n<span class=\"keyword\">then</span> alert\n</code></pre><p>and we’re good to go, anytime fak3r.com fails to load (with a 10 second timeout allowance) the sysop gets emailed about it.  Now this really just tells us if the service is up, so to make this a better we can add content check.  This way the check will have to be able to load the page, and then check for a content string to verify the site is <em>really</em> up, and working.  For me I’ll add have it check for part of my byline, since it if finds it in the response we know the webserver, and the database server, is working.</p>\n<pre><code>check host fak3r.com <span class=\"operator\">with</span> address fak3r.com\n<span class=\"keyword\">if</span> failed url <span class=\"keyword\">http</span>://fak3r.com <span class=\"operator\">and</span> content == <span class=\"string\">\"look out honey\"</span>\ntimeout <span class=\"number\">10</span> <span class=\"built_in\">seconds</span> <span class=\"keyword\">for</span> <span class=\"number\">1</span> cycles <span class=\"keyword\">then</span> alert\n<span class=\"keyword\">then</span> alert\n</code></pre><p>Great, this works, for me, but for my client they had other requirements.  Since we have many different sites, they want IT support to know about all of them, but only certain developers to know about certain other sites.</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"operator\"><span class=\"keyword\">check</span> host fak3r.com <span class=\"keyword\">with</span> address fak3r.com\n<span class=\"keyword\">if</span> failed url http://fak3r.com <span class=\"keyword\">and</span> content == <span class=\"string\">\"look out honey\"</span>\ntimeout <span class=\"number\">30</span> seconds <span class=\"keyword\">for</span> <span class=\"number\">1</span> cycles <span class=\"keyword\">then</span> alert\nalert it.support@company.com { <span class=\"keyword\">connection</span>, timeout }\nalert debbie.developer@company.com { <span class=\"keyword\">connection</span>, timeout }\nalert dave.developer@company.com { <span class=\"keyword\">connection</span>, timeout }</span>\n</code></pre><p>Meanwhile we may have other sites that other folks need to know about, but still have IT support be in the loop.

While I’ve grown fond of the simple/to the point alert system monit has by default, it’s easy to format the message so they’re a bit more specific, and easier to categorize.

While I've solved and committed all the autogen build issues on [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org), it still won't run; the controlling hulamanager process just hangs, with no errors or output to help out. On the mailing list this behavior is reportedly due to the (hardlinked) renaming of 'server messaging server' to 'hula messaging' server, which bombs if you use the filesystem based mdb.

href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Holzer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Jenny Holzer’s</a> art, dealing with text, originally printed as photostat, but later displayed on billboards, in Times Square on the big screen (pictured) and later projected in huge letters on buildings. The idea of presenting ones ideas, or as in this case, declared maxims for her <em>Trusims</em>. I can’t recall where i first came across this piece, but I love reading through them all, with the one “<em>abuse of power comes as no surprise</em>“ being my favorite. Even after I forgot about this piece, I never forgot that line and thought of it often. I mean think about it, does that ever <em>not</em> happen? She’s an American artist, born in 1950 in Ohio, who started using text as her primary means in the late 70s. An original version of the piece is now part of <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A2714&amp;page_number=1&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">The Museum of Modern Art</a> (MoMA) in New York, and they described it as “…<em>her pithy, ironic, and often disturbing statements have been presented on posters, T-shirts, baseball caps, and a flashing screen in Times Square, New York</em>.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[caption id=”attachment_2886” align=”alignright” width=”202” caption=”Jenny Holzer”]<a href=\"http://fak3r.com/media/jenny-holzer-truisms/attachment/jenny/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\"><img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/12/files/jenny.jpg\" alt=\"Jenny Holzer\"></a>[/caption]</p>\n<p><em>_The Photostat, _Truisms</em>, seen here presents eighty-six of Holzer’s ongoing series of maxims. Variously insightful, aggressive, or comic, they express multiple viewpoints that the artist hopes will arouse a wide range of responses. A small selection of <em>Truisms</em> includes: “A lot of professionals are crackpots”; “Abuse of power comes as no surprise”; “Bad intentions can yield good results”; and “Categorizing fear is calming.”_</p>\n<p><em>Holzer began creating these works in 1977, when she was a student in an independent study program. She hand-typed numerous “one liners,” or _Truisms</em>, which she has likened, partly in jest, to a “Jenny Holzer’s <em>Reader’s Digest</em> version of Western and Eastern thought.” She typeset the sentences in alphabetical order and printed them inexpensively, using commercial printing processes. She then distributed the sheets at random and pasted them up as posters around the city. Her <em>Truisms</em> eventually adorned a variety of formats, including T-shirts and baseball caps._</p>\n<hr>\n<p>_ _I’m assuming she won’t mind me adding to the way she displays, so I found a version of her text online and present it here, reading through them again now brought a smile to my face more than a few times.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jenny Holzer (American, born 1950) (1978-87).</strong><br><strong> (Original) Photostat, composition: 8’ x 40” (243.9 x 101.6 cm)</strong><br><strong> (c) 2010 Jenny Holzer / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York 177.1988</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n","_id":"mn6qa8cjswlp81ay","photos":[],"link":""},{"author":"phil","comments":true,"date":1213028224000,"layout":"post","slug":"john-mcsame-why-mccain-would-be-4-more-years-of-the-same","title":"John McSame - why M.c.Cain would be 4 more years of the same","wordpress_id":798,"categories":["t6idwbb7h1jugvsc"],"tags":["ij4wvrwclbm3y6ns","cetb8be7f8rtvh7s","0o1xkuhnkopxurjd","5mnmee2fs423kzqw","incyf5i08tk9bjkd","8853deswza3ukhb5","cs4jf87o0v924m5j","hb4jnu9730ciqu9b","x368yk520v3gp3gl","k9vbndy1hqssk84m"],"content":"<p><a href=\"http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/mcbush-mccain-bush.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\"><img src=\"http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/mcbush-mccain-bush-230x300.jpg\" alt=\"Why McCain would be another 4 years of the same\"></a><strong>UPDATE</strong>: months after confusing <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/18/mccain-misspeaks-on-iran-al-qaeda/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Iran and Iraq</a>, (<a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/article3582503.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">multiple</a> - <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/03/19/mccain-repeats-iranal-qa_n_92349.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">times</a>), M.c.Cain continues to try to upstage Bush’s famous canon of mis-spoken quotes by stating that <a href=\"http://www.someofnothing.com/2008/06/john-mccain-putin-germany-nothing-to.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Putin is President of Germany</a>.</p>\n<p>Say what you want about Barack Obama’s ‘change’ message, just know if you go with J.o.hn M.c.Cain you’re saying yes to four more years of Bush style politics.

Recently M.c.Cain perked my interest when he came out _in favor _of FISA, warrantless wiretapping/eavesdropping and executive power.  Funny thing is, he had the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/06/06/mccain/print.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">exact opposite opinion on these topics</a> when he was asked in December 2007!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On Wednesday, I documented J.o.hn <strong>M.c.Cain’s complete reversal of views — in the last six months alone — on FISA, warrantless eavesdropping and executive power</strong>. M.c.Cain’s diametrically opposite views were contained in a questionnaire M.c.Cain completed for <em>The Boston Globe</em> last December (wherein <strong>he rejected many of the Bush/Cheney theories</strong> of presidential omnipotence and warrantless eavesdropping) and then a statement M.c.Cain issued this week to <em>National Review</em> (wherein <strong>he embraced those same theories in order to persuade the Right</strong> that he approves of and would continue Bush’s lawless surveillance policies). </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another source states more of <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/06/mccain-supports-bushs-war_n_105610.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">what transcribed at the National Review:</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A top adviser to Senator J.o.hn M.c.Cain says Mr. <strong>M.c.Cain believes that President Bush’s program of wiretapping without warrants was lawful</strong>, a position that appears to bring him into closer alignment with the sweeping theories of executive authority pushed by the Bush administration legal team.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a letter posted online by National Review this week, the adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, said Mr. <strong>M.c.Cain believed that the Constitution gave Mr. Bush the power to authorize the National Security Agency to monitor Americans’ international phone calls and e-mail without warrants</strong>, despite a 1978 federal statute that required court oversight of surveillance…</p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a>Furthermore, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joseph-a-palermo/john-mccain-and-iraq---a_b_106071.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">M.c.Cain sounds like Bush Lite when discussing the war in Iraq</a>, witness these pontifications:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On March 20, 2003, J.o.hn M.c.Cain said on television: “The Iraqi people will greet us as liberators.” Three days later he said: “This conflict is . . . going to be relatively short.” Thereafter M.c.Cain has become one of those guys, like Thomas Friedman, who sees the looming American victory in Iraq in six-month intervals. On September 10, 2003, M.c.Cain said: “I would argue that the next three to six months will be critical.” On February 4, 2007, he said: “We can know fairly well in a few months.” On September 12, 2007, he said: “The next six months are going to be critical.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>M.c.Cain claims to have seen for himself all of the wonderful progress being made in Iraq. He doesn’t like to dwell on the 4,100 American lives lost, and the 500,000 to 1 million Iraqi deaths. Neither does he wish to acknowledge the 2 million internally displaced people, nor the 2 million refugees who have fled the country since 2003, nor the gutted infrastructure, nor the profiteering from Haliburton and KBR and other American contractors, nor the hatred and animosity the occupation of Iraq has engendered throughout the world.</p>\n<p>Nice eh?  So next, look how often M.c.Cain (you know, the maverick) <a href=\"http://www.progressivemediausa.org/2008/05/27/john-mcsame/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">voted in line with the President’s position</a> recently:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[…] it is a well known fact that Senator M.c.Cain misses the most votes in the Senate. In fact, he was crowned the most absent Senator in 2008. Therefore, <strong><em>when J.o.hn M.c.Cain even bothered to show up and vote in the Senate - which wasn’t often - he voted with Bush 100% of the time.</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ok, so that’s got to be some anomaly, surely a maverick senator wouldn’t agree with the most unpopular president in history all the time, let’s look at some earlier years:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2007</p>\n<p>95%</p>\n<p>5%</p>\n<p>2006</p>\n<p>89%</p>\n<p>11%</p>\n<p>2005</p>\n<p>77%</p>\n<p>23%</p>\n<p>2004</p>\n<p>92%</p>\n<p>8%</p>\n<p>2003</p>\n<p>91%</p>\n<p>9%</p>\n<p>2002</p>\n<p>90%</p>\n<p>10%</p>\n<p>2001</p>\n<p>91%</p>\n<p>9%</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course this all makes more sense when you realize that Karl Rove <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/03/fox-news-finally-identifi_n_104976.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">is an adviser to the M.c.Cain Campaign</a>.

Neither does he wish to acknowledge the 2 million internally displaced people, nor the 2 million refugees who have fled the country since 2003, nor the gutted infrastructure, nor the profiteering from Haliburton and KBR and other American contractors, nor the hatred and animosity the occupation of Iraq has engendered throughout the world.\n\n\nNice eh?  So next, look how often M.c.Cain (you know, the maverick) [voted in line with the President’s position](http://www.progressivemediausa.org/2008/05/27/john-mcsame/) recently:\n\n\n> [...] it is a well known fact that Senator M.c.Cain misses the most votes in the Senate. In fact, he was crowned the most absent Senator in 2008. Therefore, **_when J.o.hn M.c.Cain even bothered to show up and vote in the Senate - which wasn’t often - he voted with Bush 100% of the time._**\n\n\nOk, so that's got to be some anomaly, surely a maverick senator wouldn't agree with the most unpopular president in history all the time, let's look at some earlier years:\n\n\n> \n\n> \n> \n\n\n> \n> \n\n> 2007\n> \n\n> 95%\n> \n\n> 5%\n> \n\n\n> \n> \n\n> 2006\n> \n\n> 89%\n> \n\n> 11%\n> \n\n\n> \n> \n\n> 2005\n> \n\n> 77%\n> \n\n> 23%\n> \n\n\n> \n> \n\n> 2004\n> \n\n> 92%\n> \n\n> 8%\n> \n\n\n> \n> \n\n> 2003\n> \n\n> 91%\n> \n\n> 9%\n> \n\n\n> \n> \n\n> 2002\n> \n\n> 90%\n> \n\n> 10%\n> \n\n\n> \n> \n\n> 2001\n> \n\n> 91%\n> \n\n> 9%\n> \n\n\n\n\n\nOf course this all makes more sense when you realize that Karl Rove [is an adviser to the M.c.Cain Campaign](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/03/fox-news-finally-identifi_n_104976.html).

M.c.Cain’s diametrically opposite views were contained in a questionnaire M.c.Cain completed for <em>The Boston Globe</em> last December (wherein <strong>he rejected many of the Bush/Cheney theories</strong> of presidential omnipotence and warrantless eavesdropping) and then a statement M.c.Cain issued this week to <em>National Review</em> (wherein <strong>he embraced those same theories in order to persuade the Right</strong> that he approves of and would continue Bush’s lawless surveillance policies). </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another source states more of <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/06/mccain-supports-bushs-war_n_105610.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">what transcribed at the National Review:</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A top adviser to Senator J.o.hn M.c.Cain says Mr. <strong>M.c.Cain believes that President Bush’s program of wiretapping without warrants was lawful</strong>, a position that appears to bring him into closer alignment with the sweeping theories of executive authority pushed by the Bush administration legal team.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a letter posted online by National Review this week, the adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, said Mr. <strong>M.c.Cain believed that the Constitution gave Mr. Bush the power to authorize the National Security Agency to monitor Americans’ international phone calls and e-mail without warrants</strong>, despite a 1978 federal statute that required court oversight of surveillance…</p>\n<p>","_id":"9udiv0oroy0fqgpc","photos":[],"link":""},{"author":"phil","comments":true,"date":1134519600000,"layout":"post","slug":"john-vanderslice-show-posted-for-download","title":"John Vanderslice show posted for download","wordpress_id":57,"categories":["cqw66jld2sx6kyso"],"content":"<p><a href=\"http://www.fanaticpromotion.com/photos/john_vanderslice/john_vanderslice_3.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\"></a>Yesterday the venerable Pitchfork noted that John Vanderslice had released a recent live show for gratis on his website.

Examples of McCain’s departure from the Bush administration’s agenda are truly few and far between. Despite reports to the contrary, he has consistently supported and facilitated the most egregiously radical aspects of that agenda. Further, in an attempt to improve his prospects for the Republican nomination in 2008, he has spent much of the last three years sucking up to the theocon wing of the Republican Party that he once decried. Most famously, this included <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2006/04/02/mccain-falwell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">retracting comments he made about Jerry Falwell</a> and then <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/13/AR2006051300647.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">speaking at Falwell’s Liberty University</a>.

McCain is <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/13/AR2006051300647.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">the most frequent guest on Sunday morning talk shows</a>, whose hosts clearly have done a terrible job of exposing the truth about him. We simply can’t trust the gatekeepers of our conventional wisdom to treat John McCain with any skepticism whatsoever. I am sure we will see much of the same lapdog treatment from the pundit elite when it comes to <a href=\"http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=politicsNews&amp;storyID=2007-01-01T080750Z_01_N31302200_RTRUKOC_0_US-IRAQ-USA-POLITICS.xml&amp;WTmodLoc=PolNewsHome_C1_%5BFeed%5D-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">the McCain doctrine</a>, otherwise known as escalation in Iraq.

The line on McCain’s national image will be drawn here, and drawn now. Today, I am proposing a long-term, anti-McCain googlebomb project similar to the <a href=\"http://www.mydd.com/tag/googlebomb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Googlebomb the Elections</a> campaign I founded in 2006.

Examples of McCain's departure from the Bush administration's agenda are truly few and far between. Despite reports to the contrary, he has consistently supported and facilitated the most egregiously radical aspects of that agenda. Further, in an attempt to improve his prospects for the Republican nomination in 2008, he has spent much of the last three years sucking up to the theocon wing of the Republican Party that he once decried. Most famously, this included [retracting comments he made about Jerry Falwell](http://thinkprogress.org/2006/04/02/mccain-falwell/) and then [speaking at Falwell's Liberty University](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/13/AR2006051300647.html).

McCain is [the most frequent guest on Sunday morning talk shows](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/13/AR2006051300647.html), whose hosts clearly have done a terrible job of exposing the truth about him.

This is certainly not the customary wait time for a reply from LinkedIn Customer Support. We have been experiencing higher than expected volumes, and your patience is greatly appreciated.</em>“ So, they’ve been so busy that it took 2 1/2 weeks to get back to me? Still, they haven’t answered my questions, one what happened and two, who did they email on my behalf? I need a list. Stay tuned.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE </strong>today is October 17, 2011, so it’s been a week since I’ve reported my problem, and I have not gotten anything back from LinkedIn support. Pathetic.</p>\n<p>Today is October 12, 2011, so first off, if you have recently recieved a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">LinkedIn</a> request from me; I apologize for this. I used the “<em>See Who You Already Know on LinkedIn</em>“ (they claim to be able to pull contacts from over 39 providers) on LinkedIn to find new people to connect with in <a href=\"http://gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Gmail</a> contact list.  It found over 400 of them, so <strong>I chose a few of them</strong> to email, and<strong> it emailed ALL OF THEM and more</strong>. This included people I’m already linked in to, technology related mailing lists that I’m on, email alaises for my domain (?) and <strong>deceased relatives</strong>…it’s really a disaster. Oh, I’ve gotten<strong> 5 requests FROM MYSELF to connect</strong>, and it even posted on my blog, via the <a href=\"https://disqus.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">DISQUS</a> comment system, as me, but only to one old post. Plus today it sent a followup, presumably to everyone it emailed the other day, and was nice enough to update the thread on my site, reminding me of the contact request. My support requests to LinkedIn haven’t been answered and it’s been almost 36 hours, my support history looks like this:</p>\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n\n<p>[caption id=”attachment_3354” align=”aligncenter” width=”560” caption=”My LinkedIn support history, to which I did get a reply…an Auto-response. “Thanks for contacting us and we’ll get back to you as soon as possible.” (10/10/2011 09:56 )”]<a href=\"http://fak3r.com/commentary/linkedin-is-spamming-all-of-my-gmail-contacts/attachment/2g/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\"><img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/12/files/2g.png\" alt=\"My LinkedIn support history\"></a>[/caption]</p>\n<p>In short, I’m very sorry for the trouble and am doing everything I can to fix it.</p>\n<p>Look, <strong>I’ve been on LinkedIn since about ~2003</strong>, after being hipped to it by a co-worker at the time, and have dug its social networking focusing on business aspect in getting back in touch with old co-workers, but as it’s evolved and grown over the years, some things about it have become a bit too much for me. Regardless, I’ve stuck with it since I’ve been on it so long, and find it a nice ‘set and forget’ style of social networking that doesn’t require a lot of maintenance. I created a ‘group’ early on, since there weren’t any representing <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation)</a>, and after a few years we’re now at 1200+ users generating some interesting discussion (by the way, if you’re on LinkedIn and want to join the group, check it out <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&amp;gid=66993\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">here</a>). It’s an unofficial, official list, as I’ve talked to EFF and they’re happy with me, simply a long-time member and supporter, running things, and I’ve made it clear to them if they ever want to take it over that I will give them control and step down.</p>\n<p>Now, today is Oct 14, 10AM CST, and my ‘Support’ History looks exactly the same; my desperate <em>JANE! STOP THIS CRAZY THING!</em> emails, <strong>I have not received any replies to tickets</strong>. This is very disappointing. Ok, so let me list out some more details of what’s been going on, as far as LinkedIn spamming all of my Gmail contacts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Some_examples\">Some examples</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>As soon as I checked off the people I wanted to connect with and hit ‘Next’, I started getting Out of Office replies from many different email addresses. I noticed some of these were <strong>people that I had unchecked on the previous page</strong> so they wouldn’t recieve any email from me, but some from <strong>people that were not on the previous page</strong>! At that point, I realized something had gone terribly wrong.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Next came updates from technical mailing lists I subscribe to. Now obviously <strong>I wouldn’t want to send a LinkedIn request to a mailing list, but apparently I did</strong>, and it’s gotta be the most embarrassing thing in this whole debacle; technical folks emailing me, “I think you have a virus”. Thankfully, the better configured mailing list software refused my requests with something similar to the following, but the point is, mailing lists were not on the pages that I went through to uncheck people, because <strong>I would have unchecked any mailing lists!</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’d like to add you to my professional network on LinkedIn.<br>The command “I’d” is invalid.<br>Use the “help topics” command to see a list of valid commands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Stopping at signature separator.  No more commands will be processed.<br>Valid commands processed: 0<br>0 succeeded, 0 stalled, and 0 failed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&gt;<br>The command “ “ is invalid.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Use the “help topics” command to see a list of valid commands.</p>\n<p>Discarded 17 line(s) of unrecognized text.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Next up are <strong>people I’m already LinkedIn to, some of the received three (3) emails from me to connect with them</strong>…again, these are people I was already LinkedIn with!</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>I got <strong>emails to email alaises I have setup for my domains</strong>, some of them 10 years old. So emails to email aliases like admin@, sysadmin@, abuse@, hello@, etc. Really? They harvested that much from my account to email even aliases of my own domains? Unreal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[caption id=”attachment_3401” align=”aligncenter” width=”477” caption=”ARGGG!!! MAKE IT STOP!!!”]<a href=\"http://fak3r.com/commentary/linkedin-is-spamming-all-of-my-gmail-contacts/attachment/2t/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\"><img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/12/files/2t.png\" alt=\"ARGGG!!! MAKE IT STOP!!!\"></a>[/caption]</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>I really enjoyed getting my own requests, I got 5 or 6 of them</strong>, they were mainly from the email aliases, but a few came to real email addresses of mine. I followed the link to try and accept my request, but LinkedIn told me “You can’t connect with yourself”  0_o  Thanks, wish you thought of that before you spammed me!</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Then the one where <strong>I knew I had unchecked the person, because that person was deceased,</strong> which I mentioned to my wife at the time. Not only did I get the email bounce back because that account is no longer valid, but also a reply from his employeer with the, “Sorry, to tell you that he passed … due to health problems.” Ugh!</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Then, a really curious on,<strong> the request showed up on fak3r.com, this site, as a comment to one of my posts, posted by me (!)</strong> via my <a href=\"https://disqus.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">DISQUS</a> account! The comment didn’t show up on my most recent post, or all of my posts, but just one posted on September 13, 2006! So now I have not only spammed tons of people, but I spammed my own site, and makes me wonder, did I post to other sites via my DISQUS account? Oh, and then nicely a few days later when I got another round of emails ‘reminding’ me that I wanted to be a connection, it updated itself on the same comment thread. Time to change some passwords, eh?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So while this was going on, I searched online to make sure I wasn’t the only one that has gotten this treatment, and ya, I’m in good company, so that makes me feel better.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Meh,_at_least_I_have_company\">Meh, at least I have company</h2>\n<p>Last month:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I unintentionally had Linkedin send invitations to all my email contacts, including my 11 year old granddaughter~Yikes!

This is certainly not the customary wait time for a reply from LinkedIn Customer Support. We have been experiencing higher than expected volumes, and your patience is greatly appreciated._\" So, they've been so busy that it took 2 1/2 weeks to get back to me? Still, they haven't answered my questions, one what happened and two, who did they email on my behalf? I need a list. Stay tuned.\n\n**UPDATE **today is October 17, 2011, so it's been a week since I've reported my problem, and I have not gotten anything back from LinkedIn support. Pathetic.\n\nToday is October 12, 2011, so first off, if you have recently recieved a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) request from me; I apologize for this. I used the \"_See Who You Already Know on LinkedIn_\" (they claim to be able to pull contacts from over 39 providers) on LinkedIn to find new people to connect with in [Gmail](http://gmail.com) contact list.  It found over 400 of them, so **I chose a few of them** to email, and** it emailed ALL OF THEM and more**. This included people I'm already linked in to, technology related mailing lists that I'm on, email alaises for my domain (?) and **deceased relatives**...it's really a disaster. Oh, I've gotten** 5 requests FROM MYSELF to connect**, and it even posted on my blog, via the [DISQUS](https://disqus.com/) comment system, as me, but only to one old post. Plus today it sent a followup, presumably to everyone it emailed the other day, and was nice enough to update the thread on my site, reminding me of the contact request. My support requests to LinkedIn haven't been answered and it's been almost 36 hours, my support history looks like this:\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3354\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"560\" caption=\"My LinkedIn support history, to which I did get a reply...an Auto-response. \"Thanks for contacting us and we’ll get back to you as soon as possible.\" (10/10/2011 09:56 )\"][![My LinkedIn support history](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/12/files/2g.png)](http://fak3r.com/commentary/linkedin-is-spamming-all-of-my-gmail-contacts/attachment/2g/)[/caption]\n\nIn short, I'm very sorry for the trouble and am doing everything I can to fix it.\n\nLook, **I've been on LinkedIn since about ~2003**, after being hipped to it by a co-worker at the time, and have dug its social networking focusing on business aspect in getting back in touch with old co-workers, but as it's evolved and grown over the years, some things about it have become a bit too much for me. Regardless, I've stuck with it since I've been on it so long, and find it a nice 'set and forget' style of social networking that doesn't require a lot of maintenance. I created a 'group' early on, since there weren't any representing [EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation)](https://www.eff.org/), and after a few years we're now at 1200+ users generating some interesting discussion (by the way, if you're on LinkedIn and want to join the group, check it out [here](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&gid=66993)). It's an unofficial, official list, as I've talked to EFF and they're happy with me, simply a long-time member and supporter, running things, and I've made it clear to them if they ever want to take it over that I will give them control and step down.\n\nNow, today is Oct 14, 10AM CST, and my 'Support' History looks exactly the same; my desperate _JANE! STOP THIS CRAZY THING!_ emails, **I have not received any replies to tickets**. This is very disappointing. Ok, so let me list out some more details of what's been going on, as far as LinkedIn spamming all of my Gmail contacts.\n\n\n## Some examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n  * As soon as I checked off the people I wanted to connect with and hit 'Next', I started getting Out of Office replies from many different email addresses. I noticed some of these were **people that I had unchecked on the previous page** so they wouldn't recieve any email from me, but some from **people that were not on the previous page**! At that point, I realized something had gone terribly wrong.\n\n\t\n  * Next came updates from technical mailing lists I subscribe to. Now obviously **I wouldn't want to send a LinkedIn request to a mailing list, but apparently I did**, and it's gotta be the most embarrassing thing in this whole debacle; technical folks emailing me, \"I think you have a virus\". Thankfully, the better configured mailing list software refused my requests with something similar to the following, but the point is, mailing lists were not on the pages that I went through to uncheck people, because **I would have unchecked any mailing lists!**\n\n\n\n\n> >>>> I'd like to add you to my professional network on LinkedIn.\nThe command \"I'd\" is invalid.\nUse the \"help topics\" command to see a list of valid commands.\n\nStopping at signature separator.  No more commands will be processed.\nValid commands processed: 0\n0 succeeded, 0 stalled, and 0 failed.\n>>>>\nThe command \" \" is invalid.\n\nUse the \"help topics\" command to see a list of valid commands.\n\nDiscarded 17 line(s) of unrecognized text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n  * Next up are **people I'm already LinkedIn to, some of the received three (3) emails from me to connect with them**...again, these are people I was already LinkedIn with!\n\n\t\n  * I got **emails to email alaises I have setup for my domains**, some of them 10 years old. So emails to email aliases like admin@, sysadmin@, abuse@, hello@, etc. Really? They harvested that much from my account to email even aliases of my own domains? Unreal.\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3401\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"477\" caption=\"ARGGG!!! MAKE IT STOP!!!\"][![ARGGG!!! MAKE IT STOP!!!](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/12/files/2t.png)](http://fak3r.com/commentary/linkedin-is-spamming-all-of-my-gmail-contacts/attachment/2t/)[/caption]\n\n\n\n\t\n  * **I really enjoyed getting my own requests, I got 5 or 6 of them**, they were mainly from the email aliases, but a few came to real email addresses of mine. I followed the link to try and accept my request, but LinkedIn told me \"You can't connect with yourself\"  0_o  Thanks, wish you thought of that before you spammed me!\n\n\t\n  * Then the one where **I knew I had unchecked the person, because that person was deceased,** which I mentioned to my wife at the time. Not only did I get the email bounce back because that account is no longer valid, but also a reply from his employeer with the, \"Sorry, to tell you that he passed ... due to health problems.\" Ugh!\n\n\t\n  * Then, a really curious on,** the request showed up on fak3r.com, this site, as a comment to one of my posts, posted by me (!)** via my [DISQUS](https://disqus.com/) account! The comment didn't show up on my most recent post, or all of my posts, but just one posted on September 13, 2006! So now I have not only spammed tons of people, but I spammed my own site, and makes me wonder, did I post to other sites via my DISQUS account? Oh, and then nicely a few days later when I got another round of emails 'reminding' me that I wanted to be a connection, it updated itself on the same comment thread. Time to change some passwords, eh?\n\n\nSo while this was going on, I searched online to make sure I wasn't the only one that has gotten this treatment, and ya, I'm in good company, so that makes me feel better.\n\n\n## Meh, at least I have company\n\n\nLast month:\n\n\n> I unintentionally had Linkedin send invitations to all my email contacts, including my 11 year old granddaughter~Yikes!

(You know, because before Apple moved to Intel chips, PowerPC/RISC was tons more efficient and x86/CISC instruction set was so old, crappy, etc…or as the marketing folks wanted you to think…)  Yes, in the past we saw how Linux was far more efficient as a server when running on an Opteron vs a G5.

His conclusion is obvious now, ”<em>Linux is found to be much faster than Apple’s OS X for statistical computing.

He had the fortune of a late-life career revival. He was a regular performer at Jovita’s, The Broken Spoke, the Continental Club. And he was also famous for bringing country music to Emo’s. He attracted a unique fan base, often opening for the Butthole Surfers. He’s also known for keeping western swing alive by performing the music of Bob Wills and Eddie Arnold.<img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/b00005nbye01mzzzzzzz.jpg\" alt=\"b00005nbye01mzzzzzzz.jpg\"> A reviewer for Playboy magazine once referred to Walser as “the Pavarotti of the Plains.” <a href=\"http://www.wfaa.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/stories/092106tswwalserobit.26dc64e.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Another writeup</a> goes on with, “Don Walser’s career didn’t really get off the ground until the late 1980s. … [his] biggest success came at age 64 when he signed with Sire Records, the label of Madonna and the Ramones. He debuted at the Grand Ol’ Opry in 1999 but was most interested in exposing country music to new audiences, the Austin American-Statesman reported Wednesday. Walser opened for rock bands like the Butthole Surfers, introducing younger crowds to<img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/b0000065jx01mzzzzzzz.jpg\" alt=\"b0000065jx01mzzzzzzz.jpg\"> Western classics like “Tumbling Tumbleweeds” and “Cherokee Maidens.” “He loved it when some kid with a ring in their nose would bring their parents and their grandparents,” Kalish told The Associated Press. “It was part of his genuineness that came across.” Walser’s career didn’t really get off the ground until the late 1980s, when he began playing small venues after spending 45 years with the National Guard. In 2000, Walser was given the National Heritage Award in Washington. He is survived by his wife Pat and their four children.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/txplsmn.jpeg\" alt=\"txplsmn.jpeg\">My connection with <a href=\"http://www.donwalser.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Don Walser</a>‘s Pure Texas Band starts in Spring 1994, when I first visited Austin with my friend Scott.  We saw them play at Babe’s, in part because his backing band consisted of steel guitar player <a href=\"http://elvispelvis.com/jimmyday.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Jimmy Day</a>, a famed steel guitarist who had played with Hank Williams Sr., Lefty Frizzell, Elvis Presley, Ernest Tubb and Willie Nelson (among others).  The musicianship of all of the players amazed me, and Don’s singing fit perfectly.  It was especially impressive since I’d never experienced that type of traditional country music, and certainly not in some small room off 6th Street in Austin.  The next day I picked up an early cd of his.

He had the fortune of a late-life career revival. He was a regular performer at Jovita’s, The Broken Spoke, the Continental Club. And he was also famous for bringing country music to Emo’s. He attracted a unique fan base, often opening for the Butthole Surfers. He's also known for keeping western swing alive by performing the music of Bob Wills and Eddie Arnold.![b00005nbye01mzzzzzzz.jpg](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/b00005nbye01mzzzzzzz.jpg) A reviewer for Playboy magazine once referred to Walser as \"the Pavarotti of the Plains.\" [Another writeup](http://www.wfaa.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/stories/092106tswwalserobit.26dc64e.html) goes on with, \"Don Walser's career didn't really get off the ground until the late 1980s. ... [his] biggest success came at age 64 when he signed with Sire Records, the label of Madonna and the Ramones. He debuted at the Grand Ol' Opry in 1999 but was most interested in exposing country music to new audiences, the Austin American-Statesman reported Wednesday. Walser opened for rock bands like the Butthole Surfers, introducing younger crowds to![b0000065jx01mzzzzzzz.jpg](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/b0000065jx01mzzzzzzz.jpg) Western classics like \"Tumbling Tumbleweeds\" and \"Cherokee Maidens.\" \"He loved it when some kid with a ring in their nose would bring their parents and their grandparents,\" Kalish told The Associated Press. \"It was part of his genuineness that came across.\" Walser's career didn't really get off the ground until the late 1980s, when he began playing small venues after spending 45 years with the National Guard. In 2000, Walser was given the National Heritage Award in Washington. He is survived by his wife Pat and their four children.\"\n\n![txplsmn.jpeg](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/txplsmn.jpeg)My connection with [Don Walser](http://www.donwalser.com/)'s Pure Texas Band starts in Spring 1994, when I first visited Austin with my friend Scott.  We saw them play at Babe's, in part because his backing band consisted of steel guitar player [Jimmy Day](http://elvispelvis.com/jimmyday.htm), a famed steel guitarist who had played with Hank Williams Sr., Lefty Frizzell, Elvis Presley, Ernest Tubb and Willie Nelson (among others).  The musicianship of all of the players amazed me, and Don's singing fit perfectly.  It was especially impressive since I'd never experienced that type of traditional country music, and certainly not in some small room off 6th Street in Austin.  The next day I picked up an early cd of his. Years later, while living in Austin, I saw Don and the band play a handful of times, including a stint at The Broken Spoke, South Austin's old country dance hall where young and old alike did the two step waltz; a Texas memory I'll keep.  As the years have gone an I've always meant to buy more of his cds, but still only own that one; still, it's the only cd I have of the genre, and I break it out anytime I want to hear the sounds of old time West Texas swing, accompanied by Don's signature tenor yodeling.

Here’s a roundup of some very interesting news in that regard from this week.  First up, a <a href=\"http://desktoplinux.com/news/NS4958455863.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">California school district aims 5,000 desktops at Linux</a>. “<em>Windsor, Calif. School District IT administrator Heather Carver is migrating most of the district’s 70 servers and most of its 5,000 desktop machines from a mostly-Windows environment that is quickly becoming obsolete to a new mixed environment that includes PCs running SUSE Linux, Wyse Linux thin-client terminals, and a smattering of Mac and Windows machines. When all the phasing-in is completed sometime next year, <strong>the district will be operating about 2,000 SUSE Linux desktops, 50 SUSE Linux servers, 2,700 Linux thin clients, and a few hundred Mac and Windows machines for special purposes</strong>, Carver said. Additionally, <strong>she expects to save thousands of dollars each year in hardware and software costs by doing it</strong>. “One key to all this is that we’re using Citrix (as the bridge) to run Windows apps on thin-client terminals — which the adults are most used to — on the new SUSE Linux 10.1 servers,” Carver told DesktopLinux.com. “The kids, well, they adjust to new operating systems and applications very quickly, so a changeover to Linux is no big deal.</em>“</p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a><br>Next up, the <a href=\"http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=197800480\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Federal Aviation Adminsitrion considers ditching Microsoft’s Windows Vista And Office for a Linux and Google Apps combo</a>.  While this could just be an effort to ruffle feathers and get a better deal from MS, if this hold true it will continue my “no one <em>needs</em> Windows and Office to edit some spreadsheets and do word processing.  (see <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhLyiuDKNrU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">this video</a> for a demo on how to signup and use Google Apps for your domain for free (I’ve set this up for my own domains, it’s very slick — look for a full post on this soon).  “<em>March is coming in like a lion for Microsoft’s public sector business. Days after InformationWeek reported that the Department of Transportation has placed a moratorium on upgrades to Windows Vista, Office 2007, and Internet Explorer 7, <strong>the top technology official at the Federal Aviation Administration revealed that he is considering a permanent ban on the Microsoft software in favor of a combination of Google’s new online business applications running on Linux-based hardware.</strong> “It’s a different sort of computing strategy,” he said. “<strong>It takes the desktop out of the way so you’re running a very thin client. From a security and management standpoint that would have some advantages.</strong>“ Google launched Google Apps Premier Edition last month at a price of $50 per user, per year. It features online e-mail, calendaring, messaging, and talk applications, as well as a word processor and a spreadsheet. The launch followed Google’s introduction of a similar suite aimed at consumers in August. The new Premier Edition, however, offers enhancements, including 24x7 support, aimed squarely at corporate and government environments.

So today I’m working on a ton of source file conversions; moving files from here to there, running a Perl script over and over, cutting/pasting converted files out…and repeat.  It’s a task waiting for a ‘while true do’ loop, but it won’t work like that.  Anyway, so it’s a perfect day for me to get into some mid-late bebop era Jazz that I can’t get enough of, so I’m listening to Sonny Rollins’ 1966 <a href=\"http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,156128,00.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">The Bridge</a>; a more mellow (well at least mid-tempo) Rollins release featuring a sweet little quartet working it out.

So today I’m working on a ton of source file conversions; moving files from here to there, running a Perl script over and over, cutting/pasting converted files out…and repeat.  It’s a task waiting for a ‘while true do’ loop, but it won’t work like that.  Anyway, so it’s a perfect day for me to get into some mid-late bebop era Jazz that I can’t get enough of, so I’m listening to Sonny Rollins’ 1966 [The Bridge](http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,156128,00.html); a more mellow (well at least mid-tempo) Rollins release featuring a sweet little quartet working it out.

I need static IPs and I need support to help me diagnose line issues, NOT OS issues.  From them to my DSL modem, that’s all I need help with; please don’t ask me to reboot again!  Speakeasy provided me with that excellent service, but today it comes down that Best Buy has bought Speakeasy.  Forums over at <a href=\"http://www.broadbandreports.com/shownews/82567\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Broadband Reports</a> echo my sediment with universally negative comments after their posting the news.  It sums things up perfectly, and spells out why I’m very pessimistic about this being a good thing for Speakeasy, or their customers (aka me).  “<em>Speakeasy this morning <a href=\"http://www.speakeasy.net/press/pr/pr032707.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">has announced</a> that the broadband provider has been acquired by electronics retail giant Best Buy for $97 million. Founded in 1994, Speakeasy started in Seattle as an Internet cafe, and made a name for themselves as a customer-focused and community-friendly broadband provider. […] <strong>“<strong>Best Buy, like Speakeasy, is known for its high level of customer service</strong>,” insists Speakeasy CEO Bruce Chatterley in an e-mail to customers. That statement probably terrifies Speakeasy users aware of the recent <a href=\"http://www.courant.com/news/local/hc-watchdog0302,0,5198012.column?coll=hc-utility-local\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">scuff-up</a> over a secret internal Best Buy website used to scam customers out of advertised deals. Best Buy so far is insisting that little will change. Post-acquisition, the company will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Buy. </strong>“We have a high regard for Speakeasy’s employees, their culture, and their valued relationships with customers and vendors,” says Best Buy CFO Darren Jackson. __”They have a strong customer service-oriented approach, which is an excellent fit with Best Buy’s culture and direction.</em>“  So there you go, I was unable to get a small ISP that actually had good customer service when I lived in Texas, we were always outside of the lines for Speakeasy.  During that time we had SBC (which bought out Prodigy when I worked there!), since we had no choice, which was OK as long as we didn’t have any problems.  Customer service was the normal, not my problem let me transfer you to the hold queue until you got some kid who read a statement of non-support once I mentioned we ran Linux, FreeBSD and OS X at the house in response to his, “Ok, what version of Windows do you run?”.  When you call Speakeasy you get someone on the phone immediately, and that person would help you the whole time.

I need static IPs and I need support to help me diagnose line issues, NOT OS issues.  From them to my DSL modem, that's all I need help with; please don't ask me to reboot again!  Speakeasy provided me with that excellent service, but today it comes down that Best Buy has bought Speakeasy.  Forums over at [Broadband Reports](http://www.broadbandreports.com/shownews/82567) echo my sediment with universally negative comments after their posting the news.  It sums things up perfectly, and spells out why I'm very pessimistic about this being a good thing for Speakeasy, or their customers (aka me).  \"_Speakeasy this morning [has announced](http://www.speakeasy.net/press/pr/pr032707.php) that the broadband provider has been acquired by electronics retail giant Best Buy for $97 million. Founded in 1994, Speakeasy started in Seattle as an Internet cafe, and made a name for themselves as a customer-focused and community-friendly broadband provider. [...] __\"**Best Buy, like Speakeasy, is known for its high level of customer service**,\" insists Speakeasy CEO Bruce Chatterley in an e-mail to customers. That statement probably terrifies Speakeasy users aware of the recent [scuff-up](http://www.courant.com/news/local/hc-watchdog0302,0,5198012.column?coll=hc-utility-local) over a secret internal Best Buy website used to scam customers out of advertised deals. Best Buy so far is insisting that little will change. Post-acquisition, the company will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Buy. __\"We have a high regard for Speakeasy's employees, their culture, and their valued relationships with customers and vendors,\" says Best Buy CFO Darren Jackson. __\"They have a strong customer service-oriented approach, which is an excellent fit with Best Buy's culture and direction._\"  So there you go, I was unable to get a small ISP that actually had good customer service when I lived in Texas, we were always outside of the lines for Speakeasy.  During that time we had SBC (which bought out Prodigy when I worked there!), since we had no choice, which was OK as long as we didn't have any problems.  Customer service was the normal, not my problem let me transfer you to the hold queue until you got some kid who read a statement of non-support once I mentioned we ran Linux, FreeBSD and OS X at the house in response to his, \"Ok, what version of Windows do you run?\".  When you call Speakeasy you get someone on the phone immediately, and that person would help you the whole time.  Also, they understood that they provide data transfer from THEM TO MY DSL MODEM, and after that it was just TCP/IP from there; OS be damned.  We'll see what happens, but at this time I'm thinking harder about colo'ing the server and getting some cheap cable modem if (when?) things go south with Speakeasy.

I’m going to have to go ahead and sort of disagree with<br>you there. Yeah. Uh, he’s been real flaky lately and I’m not sure that<br>he’s the caliber person you want for upper management. He’s been having<br>some problems with his TPS reports.</p>\n<p><b>BOB PORTER<br></b>I’ll handle this. We feel that the problem isn’t with Peter.</p>\n<p><b>BOB SLYDELL<br></b>Um-um.</p>\n<p><b>BOB PORTER<br></b>It’s that you haven’t challenged him enough to get him really<br>motivated.</p>\n<p><b>BOB SLYDELL<br></b>There it is.</p>\n<p><b>BILL<br></b>Yeah, I’m not sure about that now.</p>\n<p><b>BOB PORTER<br></b>All right, Bill.

Michael, Samir and Peter are there.]</p>\n<p><b>PETER<br></b>There comes a place in a man’s life and, uh, maybe that time for you is<br>now, when it doesn’t hurt to think about the future.</p>\n<p><b>MICHAEL<br></b>Uh, no offense, there, Peter, but think about yourself, sport. You’re<br>the one who’s been flaking out at work.

What about it?</p>\n<p><b>PETER<br></b>Well, how does it work?</p>\n<p><b>MICHAEL<br></b>It’s pretty brilliant. What it does is where there’s a bank<br>transaction, and the interests are computed in the thousands a day in<br>fractions of a cent, which it usually rounds off. What this does is it<br>takes those remainders and puts it into your account.</p>\n<p><b>PETER<br></b>This sounds familiar.</p>\n<p><b>MICHAEL<br></b>Yeah. They did this in Superman III.</p>\n<p><b>PETER<br></b>Yeah. What a good movie.</p>\n<p><b>MICHAEL<br></b>A bunch of hackers did this in the 70s and one of them got busted.</p>\n<p><b>PETER<br></b>Well, so they check for this now?</p>\n<p><b>MICHAEL<br></b>No, you see, Initech’s so backed up with all the software we’re<br>updating for the year 2000, they’d never notice.</p>\n<p><b>PETER<br></b>You’re right. And even if they wanted to, they could never check all<br>that code.</p>\n<p><b>MICHAEL<br></b>It’s numbers up their asses.</p>\n<p><b>PETER<br></b>So, Michael, what’s to keep you from doing this?</p>\n<p><b>MICHAEL<br></b>It’s not worth the risk.

It’s completely unfair. And I realized something<br>today. It’s not about me and my dream of doing nothing. It’s about all<br>of us together. I don’t know what happened at that hypnotherapist the<br>other day; maybe it was just shock. It’s wearing off now, but when I<br>saw that fat man keel over and die, Michael, I realized that we don’t<br>have a lot of time on this earth. We weren’t meant to spend it this<br>way. Human beings weren’t meant to sit in little cubicles, starring at<br>computer screens all day, filling out useless forms and listening to<br>eight different bosses drone on about mission statements.</p>\n<p><b>MICHAEL<br></b>I told those fudge-packers that I like Michael Bolton’s music. God.</p>\n<p><b>PETER<br></b>that is not right, Michael. For five years now, you’ve worked your ass<br>off at Initech, hoping for a promotion or some kind of profit sharing<br>or something. Five years of your mid-20s now, gone. And you’re gonna go<br>in tomorrow and they’re gonna throw you out into the street. You know<br>why? So Bill Lumbergh’s stock will go up a quarter of a point. Michael,<br>let’s make that stock go down. Let’s take enough money from that place<br>that we never ever have to sit in a cubicle ever again. Your software<br>works right?</p>\n<p><b>MICHAEL<br></b>Of course it works. That’s not the point. Look, even if it could work,<br>I don’t know how to install it. I don’t know the credit union software<br>loan.</p>\n<p><b>PETER<br></b>Yeah? But Samir does.</p>\n<p>[Scene Peter’s apartment. Samir’s there, along with Michael and Peter.]</p>\n<p><b>SAMIR<br></b>But that’s not much money, I -</p>\n<p><b>PETER<br></b>That’s the beauty of it. Each withdrawal is a fraction of a cent.<br>That’s too small to notice. Take a thousand withdrawals a day, space it<br>out over a few years, that’s a couple hundred thousand dollars.</p>\n<p><b>MICHAEL<br></b>Just like Superman III.</p>\n<p><b>SAMIR<br></b>Superman III - that’s it, I have to leave now, ok? (gets up) I have to<br>get my resume ready.</p>\n<p><b>PETER<br></b>Get your resume ready for what? Another job where they can fire you for<br>no reason?</p>\n<p><b>SAMIR<br></b>That’s right! If I’m lucky.</p>\n<p><b>PETER<br></b>Look, I don’t know about you guys, but I’m tired of being pushed<br>around. Aren’t you?</p>\n<p><b>SAMIR<br></b>Yes, Peter, but I’m not going to do something illegal.</p>\n<p><b>PETER<br></b>Illegal? Samir, this is America! Come on, sit down! Come on! This isn’t<br>Riyadh! They’re not gonna saw your hands off, all right? The worse they<br>can do is put you for a couple of months into a while collar, minimum<br>security resort! Shit, we should be so lucky! Did you know they have<br>conjugal visits there?</p>\n<p><b>SAMIR<br></b>Really.</p>\n<p><b>PETER<br></b>Yes.</p>\n<p><b>MICHAEL<br></b>Shit, I’m afraid. I haven’t had a conjugal visit in six months.</p>\n<p><b>SAMIR<br></b>So what do you think?</p>\n<p><b>MICHAEL<br></b>This thing actually is pretty fail-safe, Samir.</p>\n<p><b>PETER<br></b>You came here looking for a land of opportunity. And this is the knock<br>of that opportunity. Tomorrow’s your last day at Initech. You have two<br>options</p>\n<p>unemployment or early retirement. What’s it gonna be?</p>\n<p><b>SAMIR<br></b>I have a question.</p>\n<p><b>PETER<br></b>Yes.</p>\n<p><b>SAMIR<br></b>In, in these conjugal visits, you can have sex with women?</p>\n<p><b>PETER<br></b>Yep. You sure can.</p>\n<p><b>SAMIR<br></b>Ok. I’m gonna do it.</p>\n<p><b>PETER<br></b>That’s what I’m talking about! I’m talking about America!!</p>\n<p><b>MICHAEL<br></b>Peter Let’s discuss the plan, all right?</p>\n<p><b>PETER<br></b>All right.</p>\n<p><b>MICHAEL<br></b>All right. It works like a computer virus. All right? So all we have to<br>do is load it anywhere into the credit union mainframe and it’ll do the<br>rest.</p>\n<p><b>PETER<br></b>Ok, you guys give me that disk and I’ll take it from there. Oh, but<br>listen. Before we go any further, all right, we have to swear to God,<br>Allah, that nobody knows about this, all right? No family members, no<br>girlfriends, nobody!</p>\n<p><b>SAMIR<br></b>Of course.</p>\n<p><b>MICHAEL<br></b>Agreed.</p>\n<p><b>LAWRENCE<br></b>Don’t worry man!

How do you know that?\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>They're bringing in a consultant - that's how I know. That's what this\nstaff meeting is all about! That's what happened at Initrode last year.\nYou have an interview with a consultant and they bring in efficiency\nexperts. You're interviewing for your own job!\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Tom, every week you say you're losing your job and you're still here.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>I'm going to be the first one they're gonna lay off.

You have to use your mind and come up with\nsome really great idea like that and you never have to work again!\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>I don't think the pet rock was really such a good idea.\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>The guy made a million dollars! Y'know I had an idea like that once.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Really? What was it, Tom?\n\n<b>TOM\n</b>Well, all right. It was a Jump to Conclusions-mat.

I, I gotta get outta here. I'll see you guys later, if I\nstill have a job.\n\nHe goes to his cubicle.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Our high school guidance counselor used to ask us what you would do if\nwe had a million dollars and didn't have to work. And invariably,\nwhatever we would say, that was supposed to be our careers. If you\nwanted to build cars, then you're supposed to be an auto mechanic.\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>So what did you say?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>I never had an answer. I guess that's why I'm working at Initech.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>No, you're working at Initech because that question is bullshit to\nbegin with.\n(The printer is not working)\nIf that quiz worked, there would be no janitors, because no one would\nclean shit up if they had a million dollars.\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>Well, I would invest half of it in ??? Mutual Funds and give the rest\nof it to my friend, Saheib, in Securities.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Samir, the point of the exercise is that you could figure out what you\nwant to do. And then\n(reads the printer's display)\n\"PC load letter\"?!! What the fuck does that mean?!!\n\nHe knocks off the paper tray.\n\n[Scene Peter's apartment.

The one underneath says POOF.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>\"We're not in Kansas anymore.\"\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Yeah. Really. (laughs\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>It's on your - (points\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Oh! That's, uh, that's uh, my pieces of flair.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>What are pieces of flair?\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>That's where you know, suspenders and buttons and all sorts of stuff.\nWe're, uh, we're actually required to wear fifteen pieces of flair.\nquite stupid actually.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Do you get to pick them out yourself?\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Yeah. Yeah. Although I didn't actually choose these. I, uh, I just\ngrabbed fifteen buttons and, uh, I don't even know what they say!\nY'know, I don't really care. I don't really like talking about my\nflair.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Ok.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>So, where do you work, uh, Peter?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Initech.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>And, uh, what do you do there, Peter?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>I sit in a cubicle and I update bank software for the 2000 switch.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b><b>NODS) WHAT'S THAT?\n</b>\n<b>PETER\n</b>You see, they wrote all this bank software and to save space, they put\n98 instead of 1998. So I go through these thousands of lines of code\nand uh, it doesn't really matter. I, uh, I don't like my job. I don't\nthink I'm gonna go anymore.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>You're just not gonna go?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yeah.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Won't you get fired?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>I don't know. But I really don't like it so I'm not gonna go.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b><b>LAUGHS) SO YOU'RE GONNA QUIT?\n</b>\n<b>PETER\n</b>No, no, not really. I'm just gonna stop going.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>When did you decide all that?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>About a week ago.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Really?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Oh, yeah.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Ok. So, so you're gonna get another job?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>I don't think I 'd like another job.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b><b>LAUGHS) SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT MONEY AND BILLS?\n</b>\n<b>PETER\n</b>Y'know, I never really liked paying bill? I don't think I'll do that \neither.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b><b>LAUGHS) SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?\n</b>\n<b>PETER\n</b>I want to take you out for dinner and then I wanna go to my apartment\nand watch Kung Fu. Did you ever watch Kung Fu?\n\nJoanna gets a weird look on her face.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>I love Kung Fu...\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Channel 39.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Totally...\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>You should come over and watch Kung Fu tonight.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Ok...\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Great.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Ok. Can we order lunch first?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yeah.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Ok.\n\n[Scene Milton's cubicle. He hears bill talking and eavesdrops.]\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>...stapler off my desk...\n\nMilton puts his Swingline stapler somewhere else. The guys laugh.\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>...anyway, sounds great, Bob. I'll see you in a few. (they walk off)\nHey, Milton, what's happening?\n\n<b>MILTON\n</b>Uh...sir...\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>Uh, I'm going to have to ask you to move your desk. Now, if you could\nget it to go as far back against that wall as possible, that would be\ngreat.\n\n<b>MILTON\n</b>No, no, because I was, I was -\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>That way, we'll have some room for more boxes and things we need to put\nin here.\n\n<b>MILTON\n</b>No...sir...\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>Uh (sees the Swingline) Oh there it is.\n\n<b>MILTON\n</b>No. No.\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>Let me just get that from ya. (picks it up) Great. So if you could get\nto that as soon as possible, that would be terrific. Have a nice lunch,\nMilton. Bye.\n\nHe walks off.\n\n<b>MILTON\n</b>Ok. I'll set the building on fire.\n\n[Scene Hallway at Initech. Peter enters in casual clothes. Milton walks\nup to him.]\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Peter!\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Michael!\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>What the hell's going on, man? I thought you were going to come in here\nand start shooting.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>I just came to get my address book. I'm not gonna stay. I've got a\nnumber I don't wanna lose.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>What?! Peter, you're in deep shit! You were supposed to come in on\nSaturday. What were you doing?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Michael, I did nothing. I did absolutely nothing and it was everything\nthat I thought it could be.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Well, I hope you have a better story than that for Lumbergh. You know,\nyou're supposed to be having your interview right now with the\nconsultants.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Who?\n\nHe writes down Joanna's number.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>What has gotten into you?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Oh yeah. Right.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Peter, Peter you, gotta postpone it man. Tell them you were sick. Make\nsomething up.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Ah, no way. I feel great.\n\n[Scene The interview room.]\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>The next paper looks like a Peter Gibbons.\n\nPeter enters.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Aha! All right. We were just talking about you. You must be Peter\nGibbons. Uh huh. Terrific. I'm Bob Slydell and this is my associate,\nBob Porter.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Hi, Bob. Bob.\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>Why don't you grab a seat and join us for a minute?\n\nHe does so.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Y'see, what we're trying to do here, we're just trying to get a feel\nfor how people spend their day. So, if you would, would you just walk\nus through a typical day for you?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yeah.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Great.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Well, I generally come in at least fifteen minutes late. I use the side\ndoor, that way Lumbergh can't see me. Uh, and after that, I just sorta\nspace out for about an hour.\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>Space out?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yeah. I just stare at my desk but it looks like I'm working. I do that\nfor probably another hour after lunch too. I'd probably, say, in a\ngiven week, I probably do about fifteen minutes of real, actual work.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Uh, Peter, would you be a good sport and indulge us and tell us a\nlittle more?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Let me tell you something about TPS reports...'\n\nCut to later. Peter is more relaxed.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>The thing is, Bob, it's not that I'm lazy. It's just that I just don't\ncare.\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>Don't, don't care?\n<b>PETER\n</b>It's a problem of motivation, all right? Now, if I work my ass off and\nInitech ships a few extra units, I don't see another dime. So where's\nthe motivation? And here's another thing, Bob. I have eight different\nbosses right now!\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>I beg your pardon?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Eight bosses.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Eight?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Eight, bob. So that means when I make a mistake, I have eight different\npeople coming by to tell me about it. That's my real motivation - is\nnot to be hassled. That and the fear of losing my job, but y'know, Bob,\nit will only make someone work hard enough not to get fired.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Bear with me for a minute.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Ok.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Believe me, this is hypocritical. But what if you were offered some\nkind of stock option and equity sharing program?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>I don't know. I guess. Listen, I'm gonna go. It's been really nice\ntalking to be of you guys.\n\nHe shakes their hands.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Absolutely. It's all on this side of the table, trust me.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Good luck with your layoffs. I hope your firings go really well.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Wow.\n\nCut to the cubicle's. Peter walks past them and into the hall.\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>Hey, Peter, what's happening? Listen, uh -\n\nPeter walks right past him.\n\n[Scene Chotchkie's]\n\n<b>STAN\n</b>Joanna? Would you come here for a moment, please?\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>I'm sorry. I was late. I was having lunch.\n\n<b>STAN\n</b>I need to talk about your flair.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Really? I have 15 buttons on. I, uh, (shows him\n\n<b>STAN\n</b>Well, ok, 15 is minimum, ok?\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Ok.\n\n<b>STAN\n</b>Now, it's up to you whether or not you want to just do the bare\nminimum. Well, like Brian, for example, has 37 pieces of flair. And a\nterrific smile.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Ok. Ok, you want me to wear more?\n\n<b>STAN\n</b>Look. Joanna.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Yeah.\n\n<b>STAN\n</b>People can get a cheeseburger anywhere, ok? They come to Chotchkie's\nfor the atmosphere and the attitude. That's what the flair's about.\nIt's about fun.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Ok. So, more then?\n\n<b>STAN\n</b>Look, we want you to express yourself, ok? If you think the bare\nminimum is enough, then ok. But some people choose to wear more and we\nencourage that, ok? You do want to express yourself, don't you?\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Yeah. Yeah.\n\n<b>STAN\n</b>Great. Great. That's all I ask.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Ok.\n\n[Scene Conference room. Dom and Bill are talking to the two Bob's.]\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Right. So there's three more people we can easily lose. There's Tom\nSmykowski.\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>He's useless.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Gone.\n\n<b>DOM\n</b>Sounds good to me.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Here's a peculiar one. Milton Waddams.\n\n<b>DOM\n</b>Who's he?\n\n<b>BOB\n</b>You know, squirrely looking guy, mumbles a lot.\n\n<b>DOM\n</b>Oh.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>We can't find a record of him being a current employee here.\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>I looked into it more deeply and I found what happened was he got layed\noff about five years ago and no one ever told him about it. But through\na glitch in Payroll, he still gets a paycheck. I went ahead and fixed\nthe glitch.\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>Great.\n\n<b>DOM\n</b>So, um, Milton has been let go.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Just a second there, Professor. We, uh, we fixed the glitch. So he\nwon't be receiving a paycheck anymore. So it'll just work itself out\nnaturally.\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>We always like to avoid confrontation whenever possible. The problem is\nsolved from here on, then.\n\nThey laugh.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Uh, we should move on to a Peter Gibbons. I had a chance to meet this\nyoung man and boy does he have Straight to Upper Management written all\nover him.\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>Ooh, uh, yeah. I'm going to have to go ahead and sort of disagree with\nyou there. Yeah. Uh, he's been real flaky lately and I'm not sure that\nhe's the caliber person you want for upper management. He's been having\nsome problems with his TPS reports.\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>I'll handle this. We feel that the problem isn't with Peter.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Um-um.\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>It's that you haven't challenged him enough to get him really\nmotivated.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>There it is.\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>Yeah, I'm not sure about that now.\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>All right, Bill. Let me ask you this. How much time each week would you\nsay you deal with these TPS reports?\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>Yeah...\n\n[Scene Peter parks in Bill's usual spot and goes into the building. He\ntakes a drill and removes the metal door handle.]\n\nCut to outside, where Bill has to park in the handicap spot.\n\nCut back inside. Peter tears down the banner.\n\nCut to outside. Bill's Porsche is being towed away. They only manage to\npull off the bumper.\n\nCut to Peter and Joanna watching Kung Fu. They're about to kiss.\n\n<b>LAWRENCE\n</b>Hey Peter man! Check out channel nine! It's a breast exam! Whoo!!\n\nCut to Peter's cubicle. Bill checks his watch because Peter's still not\nthere.\n\nCut to a lake. Lawrence, Peter and Joanna are fishing. Peter holds up a\nbig fish.\n\nCut to Initech. Peter enters with an Igloo cooler.\n\n<b>DOM\n</b>Hello, Peter.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Hey Dom!\n\nHe slaps him on the back.\n\nCut to Peter's cubicle. He puts the fish on his desk and starts to gut\nit. He throws its entrails on a stack of TPS reports.\n\nCut to Peter and Joanna watching Kung Fu.\n\nCut to Peter removing the screws in the cubicle wall. He pushes it\nover. It reveals a window and Peter relaxes.\n\n[Scene Peter's cubicle, now with only one wall. he's playing Tetris as\nBill walks up.]\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>So, Peter, what's happening? Now are you going to go ahead and have\nthose TPS reports for us this afternoon? (Peter keeps playing) Uh,\nyeah. So I guess we should probably go ahead and have a little talk,\nhmm?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Not right now, Lumbergh. I'm, I'm kinda busy. In fact, I'm going to\nhave to ask you to go ahead and just come back another time. I have a\nmeeting with the Bobs in a couple of minutes.\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>Uh, I wasn't aware of a meeting with them.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yeah, they called me at home.\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>That sounds good, Peter. Uh, and we'll go ahead and, uh, get this all\nfixed up for you later.\n\n[Scene Milton's cubicle. He's organizing papers.]\n\n<b>MILTON\n</b><b>F...C...P...\n</b>\n<b>BILL\n</b>Hi, Milton. What's going on?\n\n<b>MILTON\n</b>I, I, I, I, I didn't receive my paycheck this week.\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>Uh, you're gonna have to talk to Payroll about that.\n\n<b>MILTON\n</b>I, I did and they, and they said -\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>Uh, we're gonna need to move your desk downstairs into Storage B.\n\n<b>MILTON\n</b>No...I...I...\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>Uh, we have some new people coming in and we need all the space we can\nget.\n\n<b>MILTON\n</b>No...no...no...no...but...but...but...I, I, I -\n\n<b>BILL\n</b>And if you could could go ahead and get a can of psticide and take care\nof the roach problem we've been having that would be great.

I,I, I'm sure you've, you've, you've heard some\nof the rumors around the hallway about how we're just going to do a\nlittle (finger quotes) housecleaning with some of the software people.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Well, Bob, I have heard that and you gotta do what you gotta do.\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>Well, these people here. First, Mr. Samir Naga...Naga...\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Naga...\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>Naga-worker here anyway!\n\nThe Bobs laugh.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Mr. Mike Bolton. We're certainly gonna miss him.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>You're gonna layoff Samir and Michael!?\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>We're gonna bring in some entry level graduates for us to work in\nSingapore, that's the usual deal.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Well, it's standard operating procedure.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Do they know about this yet?\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>No! No, of course not. We always find it's better to fire people on a\nFriday. It's statistically shown that there's less chance of an\nincident if we do it at the end of the week. Anyway, Peter, what we\nwould like to do is put you into a position where you would have as\nmany as four people working right underneath you.\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>This is a big promotion, Pete.\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Huge.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>So you're gonna fire Samir and Michael and give me more money?\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Umm-hmm.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Wow!\n\n[Scene Michael is messing with the printer.]\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Yeah. Yeah. That's it. That's exactly what I need. Just give it to me.\nCome on. Come on, you little fucker. Let's go! That's what I need.\nLet's do that. Let's do exactly that, you little, fu-\n\nPeter walks up to him.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Listen... Well, what are you doing tonight?\n\n[Scene Peter's place. Michael, Samir and Peter are there.]\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>There comes a place in a man's life and, uh, maybe that time for you is\nnow, when it doesn't hurt to think about the future.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Uh, no offense, there, Peter, but think about yourself, sport. You're\nthe one who's been flaking out at work. Whatever that religious\nexperience or whatever the hell it was, you better snap out of it, or\nyou're gonna get canned.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yeah. I, I, I...Listen, that virus you're always talking about. The one\nthat, that could rip off the company for a bunch of money...\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Yeah? What about it?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Well, how does it work?\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>It's pretty brilliant. What it does is where there's a bank\ntransaction, and the interests are computed in the thousands a day in\nfractions of a cent, which it usually rounds off. What this does is it\ntakes those remainders and puts it into your account.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>This sounds familiar.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Yeah. They did this in Superman III.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yeah. What a good movie.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>A bunch of hackers did this in the 70s and one of them got busted.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Well, so they check for this now?\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>No, you see, Initech's so backed up with all the software we're \nupdating for the year 2000, they'd never notice.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>You're right. And even if they wanted to, they could never check all \nthat code.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>It's numbers up their asses.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>So, Michael, what's to keep you from doing this?\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>It's not worth the risk. I got a good job.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>What if you didn't have a good job?\n\n[Scene A bar. Michael and Peter are there.]\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Cockos! Samir and I are the best programmers in that place. And you,\nyou haven't even been showing up and you get to keep your job.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Actually, I'm being promoted.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>What?!!!\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yeah, I know, Michael. It's completely unfair. And I realized something\ntoday. It's not about me and my dream of doing nothing. It's about all\nof us together. I don't know what happened at that hypnotherapist the\nother day; maybe it was just shock. It's wearing off now, but when I\nsaw that fat man keel over and die, Michael, I realized that we don't\nhave a lot of time on this earth. We weren't meant to spend it this\nway. Human beings weren't meant to sit in little cubicles, starring at\ncomputer screens all day, filling out useless forms and listening to\neight different bosses drone on about mission statements.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>I told those fudge-packers that I like Michael Bolton's music. God.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>that is not right, Michael. For five years now, you've worked your ass\noff at Initech, hoping for a promotion or some kind of profit sharing\nor something. Five years of your mid-20s now, gone. And you're gonna go\nin tomorrow and they're gonna throw you out into the street. You know\nwhy? So Bill Lumbergh's stock will go up a quarter of a point. Michael,\nlet's make that stock go down. Let's take enough money from that place\nthat we never ever have to sit in a cubicle ever again. Your software\nworks right?\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Of course it works. That's not the point. Look, even if it could work,\nI don't know how to install it. I don't know the credit union software\nloan.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yeah? But Samir does.\n\n[Scene Peter's apartment. Samir's there, along with Michael and Peter.]\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>But that's not much money, I -\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>That's the beauty of it. Each withdrawal is a fraction of a cent.\nThat's too small to notice. Take a thousand withdrawals a day, space it\nout over a few years, that's a couple hundred thousand dollars.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Just like Superman III.\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>Superman III - that's it, I have to leave now, ok? (gets up) I have to\nget my resume ready.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Get your resume ready for what? Another job where they can fire you for\nno reason?\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>That's right! If I'm lucky.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Look, I don't know about you guys, but I'm tired of being pushed\naround. Aren't you?\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>Yes, Peter, but I'm not going to do something illegal.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Illegal? Samir, this is America! Come on, sit down! Come on! This isn't\nRiyadh! They're not gonna saw your hands off, all right? The worse they\ncan do is put you for a couple of months into a while collar, minimum\nsecurity resort! Shit, we should be so lucky! Did you know they have\nconjugal visits there?\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>Really.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yes.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Shit, I'm afraid. I haven't had a conjugal visit in six months.\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>So what do you think?\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>This thing actually is pretty fail-safe, Samir.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>You came here looking for a land of opportunity. And this is the knock\nof that opportunity. Tomorrow's your last day at Initech. You have two\noptions\n\nunemployment or early retirement. What's it gonna be?\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>I have a question.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yes.\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>In, in these conjugal visits, you can have sex with women?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Yep. You sure can.\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>Ok. I'm gonna do it.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>That's what I'm talking about! I'm talking about America!!\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Peter Let's discuss the plan, all right?\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>All right.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>All right. It works like a computer virus. All right? So all we have to\ndo is load it anywhere into the credit union mainframe and it'll do the\nrest.\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Ok, you guys give me that disk and I'll take it from there. Oh, but\nlisten. Before we go any further, all right, we have to swear to God,\nAllah, that nobody knows about this, all right? No family members, no\ngirlfriends, nobody!\n\n<b>SAMIR\n</b>Of course.\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Agreed.\n\n<b>LAWRENCE\n</b>Don't worry man! I won't tell anybody about this either!\n\n<b>MICHAEL\n</b>Who the fuck is that?!\n\n<b>PETER\n</b>Uh, don't worry about him. He's cool. All right. Now here's how I see\nit all going down...\n\n[Scene Initech. Peter shakes the Bobs' hands.]\n\n<b>BOB SLYDELL\n</b>Peter, congratulations. This is one heck of a promotion.\n\n<b>BOB PORTER\n</b>And we'll go ahead and get some people under you right away.\n\n (They give a thumbs up.\n\n[Scene Samir and Michael's cubicle.

He broke both his wrists, his legs, a couple of ribs, his\nback. But check it out. He's gonna get a huge settlement out of this.\nLike seven figures. He's getting out of the hospital this weekend and\nhe's throwing a big party to celebrate. I'm thinking I'm gonna take\nthat new chick from Logistics. I might be showing her my O face. Oh!\nOh! Oh! you know what I'm talking about. Oh! Yeah. Right. See you guys\nthere.\n\n[Scene Peter's car.

No. You don't understand. It's, uh, very complicated. It's, uh,\nit's, it's aggregate so I'm talking about fractions of a cent that, uh,\nover time, they add up to a lot.\n\n<b>JOANNA\n</b>Ok.

Far from it. Dawkins, at 71, remains an unbending and sharp-tongued critic of religious dogmatism. Like any scientist who challenges the Bible and its lyrical version of creation, he spends a great deal of time defending Charles Darwin’s theory that all life, including humans, evolved over eons through natural selection, rather than being molded 10,000 years ago by an intelligent but unseen hand.</em></p>\n<p><em>Dawkins, who retired from Oxford University in 2008 after 13 years as a professor of public understanding of science (meaning he lectured and wrote books), stepped into the limelight in 1976, at the age of 35, with the publication of The Selfish Gene. The book, which has sold more than a million copies, argues persuasively that evolution takes place at the genetic level; individuals die, but the fittest genes survive. Dawkins has since written 10 more best-sellers, including most recently The Magic of Reality: How We Know What’s Really True. Since 9/11 he has become more outspoken about his skepticism, culminating in The God Delusion, which provides the foundation for his continuing debates with believers. Published in 2006, the book has become Dawkins’s most popular, available in 31 languages with 2 million copies sold. That same year he founded the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science “to support scientific education, critical thinking and evidence-based understanding of the natural world in the quest to overcome religious fundamentalism, superstition, intolerance and suffering.” His books have made Dawkins a popular speaker and champion of critical thinking. In March he spoke to 20,000 people at the Reason Rally on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.; a week later he was at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, offering encouragement to the first gathering of atheistic and agnostic soldiers ever allowed on a U.S. military base.</em></p>\n<p><em>Dawkins lives in Oxford with his third wife, Lalla Ward, best known for her role as Romana on Doctor Who. But he is rarely home for long, and Contributing Editor <strong>Chip Rowe</strong> had to travel to three cities to complete their conversation. He reports: “Dawkins is a careful speaker with little patience for foolishness (which is everywhere, especially among the faithful and the occasional journalist), but he straightens and his eyes dance when he is asked to explain an evolutionary principle. We met for the first time in Las Vegas at a convention for skeptics. We talked again when he visited New York to lecture at Cooper Union and in Washington, where he spoke at Howard University, checked in with the director of his foundation, thanked its volunteers and visited the impressive human origins exhibit at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History. During a tour with the exhibit’s curator, Dawkins looked pained anytime he was compelled to chat, glancing furtively at the fossilized eye candy in every direction, including a wall of progressively modern skulls. At one point two young women approached. ‘This is Richard Dawkins!’ one told the other, wide-eyed. I suppose it’s like bumping into Bono at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.”</em></p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: What is the A pin you’re wearing?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: It stands for “atheist.”</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Like a scarlet letter?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: It’s not meant to reflect that. It’s part of my foundation’s Out Campaign. It means stand out and reach out, as well as come out for the beliefs you hold, and give the reasons. It’s a bit analogous to gay people coming out.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Although atheists can marry one another.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: True.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Is there a better word for a nonbeliever than atheist? Darwin preferred agnostic. Some have suggested humanist, naturalist, nontheist.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Darwin chose agnostic for tactical reasons. He said the common man was not ready for atheism. There’s a lovely story the comedian Julia Sweeney tells about her own journey from devout Catholicism to atheism. After she’d finally decided she was an atheist, something appeared about it in the newspaper. Her mother phoned her in hysterics and said something like “I don’t mind you not believing in God, but an atheist?” [<em>laughs</em>] The word bright was suggested by a California couple. I think it’s rather a good word, though most of my atheist friends think it suggests religious people are dims. I say, “What’s wrong with that?” [<em>laughs</em>]</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You’ve described yourself as a “tooth fairy” agnostic. What is that?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Rather than say he’s an atheist, a friend of mine says, “I’m a tooth fairy agnostic,” meaning he can’t disprove God but thinks God is about as likely as the tooth fairy.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: So you don’t completely rule out the idea of a supreme being. Critics see that as leaving an opening.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: You can think so, if you think there’s an opening for the tooth fairy.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: It sounds like the argument made by Bertrand Russell, who said that while he could claim a teapot orbited the sun between Earth and Mars, he couldn’t expect anyone to believe him just because they couldn’t prove him wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: It’s the same idea. It’s a little unfair to say it’s like the tooth fairy. I think a particular god like Zeus or Jehovah is as unlikely as the tooth fairy, but the idea of some kind of creative intelligence is not quite so ridiculous.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: So you aren’t taking Pascal up on his wager. He was the 17th century philosopher who argued it’s a smarter bet to believe in God, because if you’re wrong——</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: The cost of failure is very high. But what if you choose the wrong god to believe in? What if you get up there and it’s not Jehovah but Baal? [laughs] And even if you pick the right god, why should God be so obsessive about you believing in him? Plus, any god worth its salt is going to realize you’re feigning. The odds are extremely low, but nevertheless it’s worth it because the reward is extremely high. But you may also be wasting your life. You go to church every Sunday, you do penance, you wear sackcloth and ashes. You have a horrible life, and then you die and that’s it.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Assume there is a god and you were given the chance to ask him one question. What would it be?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: I’d ask, “Sir, why did you go to such lengths to hide yourself?”</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Do you have any deeply religious friends?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: No. It’s not that I shun them; it’s that the circles I move in tend to be educated, intelligent circles, and there aren’t any religious people among them that I know of. I’m friendly with some bishops and vicars who kind of believe in something and enjoy the music and the stained glass.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking reference God in their writings. Are they using the word in the sense of an intelligent designer?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Certainly not. They use god in a poetic, metaphorical sense. Einstein in particular loved using the word to convey an idea of mystery, which I think all decent scientists do. But nowadays we’ve learned better than to use the word god because it will be willfully misunderstood, as Einstein was. And poor Einstein got quite cross about it. “I do not believe in a personal god,” he said over and over again. In a way he was asking for it. Hawking uses it in a similar way in A Brief History of Time. In his famous last line he says that if we understood the universe, “then we would know the mind of God.” Once again he is using god in the Einsteinian, not the religious sense. And so Hawking’s The Grand Design, in which he says the universe could have come from nothing, is not him turning away from God; his beliefs are exactly the same.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You’ve had a lot of fun deconstructing the idea of the intelligent designer. You point out that God made a cheetah fast enough to catch a gazelle and a gazelle fast enough to outrun a cheetah——</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Yes. Is God a sadist?</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: And bad design such as the fact we breathe and eat through the same tube, making it easy to choke to death.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Or the laryngeal nerve, which loops around an artery in the chest and then goes back up to the larynx.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Not very efficient.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Not in a giraffe, anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You argue Christians worship a “created God.” Some Christians respond that their God isn’t created; he’s eternal.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: You could say the same of the universe. You could say elephants support the world on their backs. There have always been elephants. I declare it by fiat.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: The attacks of 9/11 seemed to make you more militant about your atheism, as if you had finally lost patience.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: There was a certain amount of that. A lot of people in the world felt a desire to stand up and be counted. Any suggestion of anti-Americanism in my mind vanished. Ich bin ein Amerikaner. Then George W. Bush destroyed that. But it was also an anti-Islamic and an antireligious moment for me because I was nauseated by the way the response to “Allahu Akbar” was “God is with us,” or whatever the Christians said—the sound of Christian leaders in America uniting in support of the force that led to the crisis in the first place.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You blame 9/11 on belief in the afterlife.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Yes. Normally when an aircraft is hijacked, there’s an assumption that the hijackers want to go on living. It changes the game if the hijackers look forward to death because it will get them into the best part of paradise.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You mean the part with the 72 virgins the Koran says await martyrs.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Right. Young men who are too unattractive to get a woman in the real world go for the ones in paradise. But my point is these people really believe what they say they believe, whereas most Christians don’t. If you talk to dying Christians, they aren’t looking forward to it.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: What will happen when you die?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Well, I shall either be buried or be cremated.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Funny. But without faith in an afterlife, in what do you take comfort in times of despair?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Human love and companionship. But in more thoughtful, cerebral moments, I take—comfort is not quite the right word, but I draw strength from reflecting on what a privilege it is to be alive and what a privilege it is to have a brain that’s capable in its limited way of understanding why I exist and of reveling in the beauty of the world and the beauty of the products of evolution. The magnificence of the universe and the sense of smallness that gives us in space and in geologically deep time is humbling but in a strangely comforting way. It’s nice to feel you’re part of a hugely bigger picture.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Are you concerned that your opponents might fake a deathbed conversion, as creationists have tried to do with Darwin?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: What’s slightly more worrying is the Antony Flew effect. Flew was an atheistic British philosopher who had an old-age conversion. It seems he went gaga. You can’t guard against that.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: So if it happens we should assume you’ve lost it.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Yes. After my friend Christopher Hitchens was diagnosed with cancer, he was asked if he might have a conversion. He said that if he did, it wouldn’t be the real him. What’s rather wicked is when religious apologists exploit that, as they did in the case of Flew, who in his old age was persuaded to put his name to a book saying that he’d been converted to a form of deism. Not only did he not write the book, he didn’t even read it. [laughs]</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Your call for militant atheism is one reason you were featured as a character on an episode of South Park. The show’s creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, had been accused of being atheists, so they thought of the most militant atheist they could skewer.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: It’s the only South Park episode I’ve seen. There was an attempt at something approaching satire in the idea of an imagined future in which different sects of atheists are fighting each other. But most of that episode was ridiculous in the sense that what they had the cartoon figure of me doing, like buggering the bald transvestite——</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Transsexual, actually.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Transsexual, okay. That isn’t satire because it has nothing to do with what I stand for. And the scatological part, where they had somebody throwing shit, which stuck to my forehead—that’s not even funny. I don’t understand why they couldn’t go straight to the atheists fighting each other, which has a certain amount of truth in it. It reminded me of the bit from Monty Python’s Life of Brian with the Judean People’s Front and the People’s Front of Judea.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: President Obama acknowledged “nonbelievers” in his inaugural address, which caused a fuss. But when you consider religious belief, one of the largest groups in the U.S. is atheists and agnostics. Why do they get overlooked in political discussions?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: It’s a good point. Of course, it depends how you slice it. Christians are by far the largest group. If you divide Christians into denominations, agnostics and atheists come in third, behind Catholics and Baptists. That’s interesting when you contrast it with the lack of influence of nonbelievers. And if you count up the number of Jews, certainly observant Jews, it’s much smaller than the number of nonbelievers. Yet Jews have tremendous influence. I’m not criticizing that—bully for them. But we could do the same.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You’re not hopeful about peace between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: There’s not much hope to the extent that the most influential protagonists both base their hostility on 2,000-year-old books that they believe give them title to the land.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: What is your view of Jesus?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: The evidence he existed is surprisingly shaky. The earliest books in the New Testament to be written were the Epistles, not the Gospels. It’s almost as though Saint Paul and others who wrote the Epistles weren’t that interested in whether Jesus was real. Even if he’s fictional, whoever wrote his lines was ahead of his time in terms of moral philosophy.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You’ve read the Bible.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: I haven’t read it all, but my knowledge of the Bible is a lot better than most fundamentalist Christians’.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Do you have a favorite verse?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: My favorite book is Ecclesiastes. It’s wonderful poetry in 17th century English, and I’m told it’s very good in the Hebrew. “Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.” The Song of Songs is terrific, and it’s more bawdy in the Hebrew, almost a drinking song.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You’ve made the point that if Jesus existed and went to his death as described in the Bible, it was, as you put it, “barking mad.”</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: There’s no evidence Jesus himself was barking mad, but the doctrine invented later by Paul that Jesus died for our sins surely is. It’s a truly disgusting idea that the creator of the universe—capable of inventing the laws of physics and designing the evolutionary process—that this protégé of supernatural intellect couldn’t think of a better way to forgive our sins than to have himself tortured to death. And what a terrible lesson to say we’re born in sin because of the original sin of Adam, a man even the Catholic Church now says never existed.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: We hear constantly that America is a Christian nation and that the founding fathers were all Christians.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: They were deists. They didn’t believe in a personal god, or one who interferes in human affairs. And they were adamant that they did not want to found the United States as a Christian nation.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: But you hear quite often that if you let atheists run things you end up with Hitler and Stalin.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Hitler wasn’t an atheist; he was a Roman Catholic. But I don’t care what he was. There is no logical connection between atheism and doing bad things, nor good things for that matter. It’s a philosophical belief about the absence of a creative intelligence in the world. Anybody who thinks you need religion in order to be good is being good for the wrong reason. I’d rather be good for moral reasons. Morals were here before religion, and morals change rather rapidly in spite of religion. Even people who rely on the Bible use nonbiblical criteria. If your criteria are scriptural, you have no basis for choosing the verse that says turn the other cheek rather than the verse that says stone people to death. So you pick and choose without guidance from the Bible.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You’ve said that science is losing the war with religion.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Did I say we were losing? I was just having an off day.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You are surprised science is still being challenged.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: I am surprised, but I’m not sure it’s a losing battle. If you take the long view of centuries, there’s an upward trend. Religious people like to point out that Isaac Newton was religious. Well, of course he was—he lived before Darwin. It would have been difficult to be an atheist before Darwin.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You might have been the guy who didn’t believe in Zeus.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: I would have been skeptical of the details of Zeus hurling thunderbolts, but I probably would have believed in some supernatural being. When you look around at the living world and see the complexity of a cell and the elegance of a tree—“I think that I shall never see / A poem lovely as a tree. / Poems are made by fools like me, / But only God can make a tree”—I would have been moved by that. Darwin changed all that. He provided a simple, explicable, workable story about how you can get the complexity not just of a tree but of a human by physics working through the rather special process of evolution by natural selection. If only Newton had been alive to be told about that.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: The evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould viewed science and religion as——</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Non-overlapping magisteria, or NOMA.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Completely separate.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: That’s pure politics. Gould was trying to win battles in the creation-evolution debate by saying to religious people, “You don’t have to worry. Evolution is religion-friendly.” And the only way he could think to do that was to say they occupy separate domains. But he overgenerously handed the domains of morals and fundamental questions to religion, which is the last thing you should do. Science cannot at present—maybe never—answer the deep questions about existence and the origins of the fundamental laws of nature. But what on earth makes you think religion can? If science can’t provide an answer, nothing can.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Some scientists say that you should stop talking about atheism because it muddies the waters in the debate over evolution.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: If what you’re trying to do is win the tactical battle in U.S. schools, you’re better off lying and saying evolution is religion-friendly. I don’t wish to condemn people who lie for tactical reasons, but I don’t want to do that. For me, this is only a skirmish in the larger war against irrationality.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You’ve said that if science and religion are truly NOMA, Christians must give up their belief in miracles.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Absolutely. Miracles are a naked encroachment on science’s turf. If you ask people in the pew or on the prayer mat why they believe in God, it will always involve miracles, including the miracle of creation. If you don’t allow religion to have that, you’ve removed the reason just about everybody who is religious is religious.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Do you get discouraged by the continuing attacks on reason?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: No. I go on the internet quite a lot and read what young people are saying. I see a great upsurge of good sense, rationality, irreverence. America is split into halves. There’s the Sarah Palin know-nothing idiots on the one hand, and then there’s a huge number of intellectual, intelligent, educated people on the other. I find it hard to believe that the Stone Age types are going to win in the end. An awful lot of people who call themselves religious simply don’t know there’s any alternative. If you probe what they believe, it turns out to be pretty much the same—we all have a sense of wonder and reverence at the majesty of the universe.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You’re of the mind that religious belief probably evolved as an “accidental by-product.”</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Whenever something is widespread in a species, you have to reckon it has some sort of survival value. There’s probably no survival value in religion itself—though there might be—but value in lots of rather separate psychological predispositions such as obedience to authority. That has strong survival value for children. Because they’re helpless and don’t know their way around the world, they rely on parental wisdom. But they don’t have the means of distinguishing wisdom that is wise for survival from wisdom that is nonsense.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Your parents raised you in the Anglican church.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: I wouldn’t wish to malign my parents by suggesting they fed me religion. I was sent to some of the best schools, and as most such schools in England were at the time, they were Anglican schools. So I got daily prayers and Bible readings. I was confirmed at 13.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: When did you first read Darwin’s On the Origin of Species?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Two years later.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: And it blew your mind.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Yes. That such a simple idea could explain the complexities of a peacock’s tail, a bounding antelope, a sprinting cheetah, a flying swift, a thinking human. These are immensely complicated machines, and yet we understand why they’re here.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Your parents were naturalists who you’ve said could identify every plant in Britain.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: My father read botany at Oxford. I read zoology there. I wasn’t a naturalist in the way he was, but I loved going around the jungle with somebody who knew about it.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Is there any particular way he influenced you?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Curiosity, scientific curiosity.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: How about your mother?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: She didn’t do a degree in science, but she had a very good knowledge of plants as well. I guess that’s one of the things they did together. She educated me as a child, and I learned a great deal from her.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You were born in Nairobi. Why were your parents there?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Because of his botanical background, my father joined the agricultural department of the Colonial Civil Service and was sent to East Africa, to what was then Nyasaland and is now Malawi. Then he was called up to join the King’s African Rifles, which was the British regiment headquartered in Nairobi. So he went up north to Kenya and my mother followed. She had a certain amount of trouble. Since she wasn’t in Kenya legally, it was quite difficult getting out. [laughs]</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: What do you remember about that time?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: I remember a lot about Nyasaland. I remember the smells and sights and colors. It was a privileged existence, with servants. It was like setting the clock back 100 years; it was a strange paternalistic society we lived in.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: When you were eight you moved with your parents to England.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: My father was left the Dawkins estate, which had been in the family since 1723, by a very distant cousin—so distant we’d never heard of him. This cousin wanted the farm to stay with a Dawkins, but everyone had daughters. It was a brilliant choice because my father was qualified in agriculture, albeit tropical, and had the right kind of enterprising mind to turn what had been a country gentleman’s estate into a working farm.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: What did he grow?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: We had Jersey cows, which as you know make a lot of cream. He supplied all the local hotels and the Oxford colleges with cream. And pigs. The acreage isn’t that great. An eccentric Dawkins of the 19th century sold off most of the land to pay for lawsuits, so most of the family wealth disappeared.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Decades after moving to England, you wrote your first book during a blackout.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: In 1972 there was major industrial unrest in Britain, and for whole days there would be no power. I couldn’t do my research, so I started writing The Selfish Gene.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You’re a great fan of science fiction. What do you like about it?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: I prefer science fiction that takes some aspect of science and modifies it. There’s a lovely novel by Daniel Galouye called Dark Universe, about a group of people who live in total darkness and know nothing about light. And so light has become a mythology. They use phrases like “Great Light Almighty” and have ceremonies when they feel a sacred lightbulb. Galouye changed one thing—he removed light—and looked at all the consequences.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: As opposed to creating a fairyland.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Princesses riding unicorns isn’t science fiction.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: The Playboy Advisor received this question from a reader: “I feel uncomfortable when a person I just met asks me whether I go to church, because I don’t. Is there an etiquette to answering?”</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: I would reply, “No, I do not go to church. Do you, and if so, why?”</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: That’s what you advised your daughter in a letter you wrote her when she was 10.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: What I did, and what I would tell other parents to do, is encourage her to think for herself. As an illustration, for Santa I said, “Well, let’s work out how many chimneys there are.” I mean, it would be a fun game where we calculate that he would have to be traveling faster than the speed of light.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: What if the child bursts into tears?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Oh, that would be a shame.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Did having a child change your outlook in any way?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: I don’t think so, though I’m interested in the evolutionary origins of subjective feelings. I became palpably more nervous about things like heights.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You saw danger everywhere.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: That’s right.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You advised her that anytime someone presented her with a claim, she should ask, “What is the evidence?” Was she popular with her teachers?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: I don’t know about her, but I have heard horror stories about children who asked too many questions of teachers of religion.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: All the atheists we met at the skeptics convention in Las Vegas seemed to have a story about being kicked out of Sunday school.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Yes, that’s terribly funny. What a Sunday school teacher should say is “Let’s look at the evidence.” Instead they get cross. And the reason they get cross is that there isn’t any evidence.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: They get cross with you as well. You are asking a religious person to change his or her worldview.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: I want people to change their worldview such that they demand evidence for something they’re going to believe. It’s not a good reason to believe because “our people have always believed that.” If you’d been born in Afghanistan or India, you’d believe something else. Another lousy reason is because you have an inner feeling it must be true, or you’ve been told by a priest it’s true.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Ken Miller, author of Finding Darwin’s God, once scolded you by saying atheists and agnostics are more evangelical than religious people. Is that your experience with atheists?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: You can be passionate about the need to look at the evidence and passionately angry at people who won’t do that. That’s not evangelical; that’s just angry.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You like Miller’s book, though.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: It may well be the best refutation of creationism, though it goes off the rails when it tries to justify Christianity. One of the reasons I recommend it is not just because it’s good but because it is written by a Christian. Unfortunately it’s written by a Catholic, and many of the people we’re talking about think Catholics are worse than atheists. [laughs]</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: In 2010 you spoke at a rally in London to protest a state visit by Pope Benedict XVI.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Only about 2,000 people were expected, and 15,000 turned up.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You dismissed the pope as an enemy of children, gay people, women, truth, poor people, science and humanity.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: It was a speech at a rally, so I used rhetoric.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Do you believe, as Christopher Hitchens did, that the pope should be arrested?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Hitchens wrote me suggesting we should arrest him, but we soon gave up on the idea of literally making a citizen’s arrest by creeping up with handcuffs or something. Instead we asked Geoffrey Robertson, a distinguished human rights lawyer, to speak about the legal case against the pope for covering up pedophilia. He also looked at the alleged immunity of the pope from prosecution as the head of a state, calling into question the notion of the Vatican as a legitimate sovereign state. I responded to the pope’s uncalled-for truculence when he landed in Edinburgh. The first thing he said was to blame atheists for Hitler. Although I don’t blame the pope for being a member of the Hitler Youth, as he was very young, I felt this was pretty cheeky, really. If I were him I’d keep my head down over Hitler.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You were impressed by a few of the signs at the rally.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Two of my favorites were keep your rosaries off my ovaries and hands off my eggs, benedict. [laughs]</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: The pope apologized for the sexual abuse of children in the Catholic church. Isn’t that enough?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Oh, big deal. He hasn’t handed over any records to the police. He apologized with great reluctance after enormous pressure was brought to bear.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You gave a speech in Dublin in which you argued that sexual abuse is less damaging to a child than the psychological damage of bringing him up Catholic. What was the response?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: I got an ovation. I want to make clear I was not talking about the sort of violent sexual abuse we’ve now learned had been repeatedly going on. I was talking about mild caressing, which is bad enough, but bringing up a child to believe in hellfire is worse.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Let’s turn to evolution, which many people misunderstand, such as believing we descend from apes.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: We are apes. We descend from extinct animals that would have been classified as apes. We are not descended from modern chimps or bonobos or gorillas. They’ve been evolving for exactly the same length of time as we have.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: So what makes us human?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: We are a unique ape. We have language. Other animals have systems of communication that fall far short of that. They don’t have the same ability to communicate complicated conditionals and what-ifs and talk about things that are not present. These are all unique manifestations of our evolved ape brain, which some evidence suggests came about through a rather limited number of mutations.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Peter Singer, who co-founded the Great Ape Project, suggests apes deserve basic rights. Do you agree?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Why stop at apes? Why not pigs?</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: But apes are our cousins.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: So what? We’re all cousins. What if octopuses, which are much more distant cousins, had evolved an intelligence equivalent to ours?</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: But they didn’t.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: You can base your morals on kinship if you want, but why should you? I’d prefer to go with Jeremy Bentham and base my morals on the question, Can they suffer? Singer’s rather keen on the word speciesism. We have a common ancestor with chimps who lived 6 million years ago. If you imagine holding the hand of your mother, who holds the hand of her mother, who holds the hand of her mother, and you go on and on to the common ancestor, the line would stretch a few hundred miles. And in its other hand the grand ancestor holds her daughter’s hand who holds her daughter’s hand, and you go forward to modern chimps. As you go back, every one of those mother-daughter relationships would include members of the same species.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: So there was no first human.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: No, never. But suppose an intermediate species hadn’t gone extinct. Suppose relict populations are discovered in the African jungle. In order to deny chimpanzees rights, you would have to set up apartheid-like courts to decide whether this individual counts as human. Because it’s a continuum. As a practical matter, the intermediates haven’t survived, so it’s possible to give humans basic rights and give chimpanzees none. But I think it’s a worthwhile argument.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Are you pro-life?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: People who say they’re pro-life mean they are pro-human life. A four-cell embryo or a 64-cell embryo, or indeed one much larger than that, has no nervous system. You should have rather less compunction in killing such a creature than you would in killing an earthworm, because an earthworm has a nervous system and very likely can suffer. So objecting to the abortion of very young human embryos is utter nonsense. Objecting to older human embryos being killed is not utter nonsense. There’s no reason to suppose that their capacity to suffer is any greater than the capacity of an adult pig or cow to suffer.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Do we know which came first—bigger brains or bipedalism?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Bipedalism came first.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: How do we know that?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Fossils. That’s one place the fossils are extremely clear. Three million years ago Australopithecus afarensis were bipedal, but their brains were no bigger than a chimpanzee’s. The best example we have is Lucy [a partial skeleton found in 1974 in Ethiopia]. In a way, she was an upright-walking chimpanzee.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You like Lucy.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Yes. [smiles]</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You’ve said you expect mankind will have a genetic book of the dead by 2050. How would that be helpful?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Because we contain within us the genes that have survived through generations, you could theoretically read off a creature’s evolutionary history. “Ah, yes, this animal lived in the sea. This is the time when it lived in deserts. This bit shows it must have lived up mountains. And this shows it used to burrow.”</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Could that help us bring back a dinosaur? You have suggested crossing a bird and a crocodile and maybe putting it in an ostrich egg.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: It would have to be more sophisticated than a cross. It’d have to be a merging.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Could we re-create Lucy?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: We already know the human genome and the chimpanzee genome, so you could make a sophisticated guess as to what the genome of the common ancestor might have been like. From that you might be able to grow an animal that was close to the common ancestor. And from that you might split the difference between that ancestral animal you re-created and a modern human and get Lucy.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You’ve accused creationists of fighting dirty.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Sure they do.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Is that why you and other evolutionary biologists won’t debate them?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Partly. It also gives them a respectability they don’t deserve. A colleague of mine likes to respond, “That would look great on your CV, not so good on mine.”</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: What arguments do creationists typically hit you with?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Ignorant nonsense. They say things like “Well, if we’re descended from chimpanzees, how come chimpanzees are still around?” It isn’t difficult.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You often hear evolution described as “just a theory.” Is it?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: The word theory can mean a hypothesis. But the word is also used in a more serious sense as a body of knowledge. It’s better to use the word fact. Evolution is a fact in the same sense that the earth orbits the sun.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: There is disagreement about what drives evolution.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Natural selection is the driving force, but there is disagreement about what the selection pressure was. For example, we know the human brain grew bigger. Was it because the more ingenious individuals were the best at finding food or evading predators? Or was it because they were the most sexually attractive? It’s possible an enlarged brain is rather like a peacock’s tail. Darwin proposed a second version of natural selection, which he called sexual selection. If peahens choose peacocks for the brightness of their finery, then never mind about surviving. The ones with the biggest tails survive less well, because the tail is a burden. Nevertheless if they’re more attractive to females, then the genes for making big tails are more likely to end up in the next generation. It is quite possible the human brain also got bigger due to sexual selection. Intelligence is sexy. Maybe the most intelligent males had the gift of the gab. They may have been good talkers, good at remembering the sagas and myths of the tribe, or dance steps.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Or that she likes antelope.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Something like that. If a peahen chooses a male with a long tail, it’s because she knows he couldn’t have survived with a tail like that unless he had something going for him. It’s all about showing females you are resistant to disease. There’s a dual selection—females become better diagnostic doctors, and males become better at being diagnosed, even if they’re actually ill.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: What role does chance play in evolution?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Mutation, the raw material for natural selection, is random in the sense that it is not systematically directed toward improvement. But natural selection is highly nonrandom, because it’s choosing improvements from that pool of variation that mutation throws up. There’s also an awful lot of chance in which species go extinct. When a comet hit the earth, all the dinosaurs went extinct except birds. A few mammals survived, and we’re descended from those few mammals, perhaps those that were hibernating underground.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: You’ve described life as a “replication bomb.”</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: If you look around the universe, there’s dead world after dead world. Physics goes on and chemistry goes on, but nothing else happens. And suddenly in one place there’s an explosion, which comes about because of replication. For some reason, the laws of chemistry give rise to a molecule that self-replicates. Maybe this planet is the only time it’s ever happened. But the arising through some accident of chemistry of a molecule that makes copies of itself has momentous consequences.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Creationists often try to ambush you, such as the Australian film crew that hit you with “Can you give me an example of a genetic mutation or an evolutionary process that can be seen to increase the information in the genome?” and then, because you paused, portrayed you as not having an answer.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: The way it happens is through gene duplication. You have lengths of the genome that do some useful thing, and then a chunk gets copied and pasted somewhere else, where it’s free to evolve in a different direction.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: So why didn’t you respond?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: I was thinking, Am I going to throw these people out? This is a question only a creationist would ask, and they hadn’t told me they were creationists. What they did was splice the question and the long pause with my answer to a different question, so it looked as though I was being evasive. It was an absolutely scandalous piece of mendacity.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Most objections to evolution seem to come down to complexity. People can’t understand how something like an eye could have evolved.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: No matter how complex the eye may be, it’s not as complicated as a god.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Creationists love to cite gaps in the fossil record, such as the large one that precedes the Cambrian explosion, the period about 530 million years ago during which there was exponential growth in complex life-forms. How can you explain it?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Of course there are gaps; fossilization is a rare event. But if we didn’t have a single fossil, the evidence for evolution would be absolutely secure because of comparative anatomy, comparative biochemistry, geographical distribution. The gap before the Cambrian explosion is interesting because it’s a big one. But if you think about it, there are major groups of animals that have no fossils. For example, today we saw in the natural history museum an almost microscopic creature called a tardigrade. They don’t fossilize because they’re soft. Presumably before the Cambrian, most of the ancestors of the Cambrian creatures were soft and small.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: How do we know they existed if there are no fossils?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: That’s not quite the right question, is it? Their descendants existed in the Cambrian, so unless you seriously think they were created in the Cambrian, they must have existed. You may say that’s not evidence, and I’m saying you could say the same of any soft creature for which we have no fossils. How do we know it wasn’t created in 1800? It doesn’t make sense.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: What about this one, another favorite of creationists: If modern animals such as monkeys evolved from frogs, why haven’t we found any fossils from a transitional creature such as a fronkey?</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: The fallacy is thinking of modern animals as descended from other modern animals. If you take that seriously, there should be not just fronkey fossils but crocoduck or octocow fossils. Why on earth would you expect you could take any pair of animals and look for a combination of them? We’re looking at the tips of the twigs of the tree. The ancestors are buried deep in the middle, in the crown of the tree. There are no fronkeys because the common ancestor of a frog and a monkey would be some kind of fishy, salamandery thing that looks like neither a frog nor a monkey.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAYBOY</strong>: Creationists are fond of arguing that if you remove one part and it doesn’t work, then there’s no way it could have evolved.</p>\n<p><strong>DAWKINS</strong>: Quite a good analogy here is an arch, where you have stone, stone, stone, and then it meets in the middle and stands up. But take away any one part and it collapses. You might think it’s difficult to build an arch until you have the whole thing in place, but you’re not considering that they used scaffolding, which has since been taken down. That’s one answer. Another is to point out that you don’t need all the bits of an eye in order to see. You can have a very imperfect eye that can see only the difference between light and dark. That’s still useful if you can see the shadow of a predator. So it’s not true that half an eye is not useful. Half an eye is half as good as a whole eye, and it’s better than nothing.</p>\n","source":"_posts/playboy-interview-richard-dawkins.markdown","raw":"---\nauthor: fak3r\ncomments: true\ndate: 2012-08-20 20:18:26\nlayout: post\nslug: playboy-interview-richard-dawkins\ntitle: 'Playboy Interview: Richard Dawkins'\nwordpress_id: 3984\ncategories:\n- commentary\n- religion\ntags:\n- agnostic\n- atheist\n- interview\n- nsfw\n- religion\n- richard dawkins\n---\n\n[![The Out Campaign  ](http://fak3r.com/assets/scarlet_A.png)](http://fak3r.com/2012/08/20/playboy-interview-richard-dawkins/scarlet_a/) The Out Campaign logo\n\nToday I read the recent interview with Richard Dawkins, the English ethologist, evolutionary biologist and the worlds best known atheist, on Playboy.com, and as always found his candor enjoyable and refreshing.

Far from it. Dawkins, at 71, remains an unbending and sharp-tongued critic of religious dogmatism. Like any scientist who challenges the Bible and its lyrical version of creation, he spends a great deal of time defending Charles Darwin’s theory that all life, including humans, evolved over eons through natural selection, rather than being molded 10,000 years ago by an intelligent but unseen hand._\n\n_Dawkins, who retired from Oxford University in 2008 after 13 years as a professor of public understanding of science (meaning he lectured and wrote books), stepped into the limelight in 1976, at the age of 35, with the publication of The Selfish Gene. The book, which has sold more than a million copies, argues persuasively that evolution takes place at the genetic level; individuals die, but the fittest genes survive. Dawkins has since written 10 more best-sellers, including most recently The Magic of Reality: How We Know What’s Really True. Since 9/11 he has become more outspoken about his skepticism, culminating in The God Delusion, which provides the foundation for his continuing debates with believers. Published in 2006, the book has become Dawkins’s most popular, available in 31 languages with 2 million copies sold. That same year he founded the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science “to support scientific education, critical thinking and evidence-based understanding of the natural world in the quest to overcome religious fundamentalism, superstition, intolerance and suffering.” His books have made Dawkins a popular speaker and champion of critical thinking. In March he spoke to 20,000 people at the Reason Rally on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.; a week later he was at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, offering encouragement to the first gathering of atheistic and agnostic soldiers ever allowed on a U.S. military base._\n\n_Dawkins lives in Oxford with his third wife, Lalla Ward, best known for her role as Romana on Doctor Who. But he is rarely home for long, and Contributing Editor **Chip Rowe** had to travel to three cities to complete their conversation. He reports: “Dawkins is a careful speaker with little patience for foolishness (which is everywhere, especially among the faithful and the occasional journalist), but he straightens and his eyes dance when he is asked to explain an evolutionary principle. We met for the first time in Las Vegas at a convention for skeptics. We talked again when he visited New York to lecture at Cooper Union and in Washington, where he spoke at Howard University, checked in with the director of his foundation, thanked its volunteers and visited the impressive human origins exhibit at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History. During a tour with the exhibit’s curator, Dawkins looked pained anytime he was compelled to chat, glancing furtively at the fossilized eye candy in every direction, including a wall of progressively modern skulls. At one point two young women approached. ‘This is Richard Dawkins!’ one told the other, wide-eyed. I suppose it’s like bumping into Bono at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.”_\n\n**PLAYBOY**: What is the A pin you’re wearing?\n\n**DAWKINS**: It stands for “atheist.”\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Like a scarlet letter?\n\n**DAWKINS**: It’s not meant to reflect that. It’s part of my foundation’s Out Campaign. It means stand out and reach out, as well as come out for the beliefs you hold, and give the reasons. It’s a bit analogous to gay people coming out.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Although atheists can marry one another.\n\n**DAWKINS**: True.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Is there a better word for a nonbeliever than atheist? Darwin preferred agnostic. Some have suggested humanist, naturalist, nontheist.\n\n**DAWKINS**: Darwin chose agnostic for tactical reasons. He said the common man was not ready for atheism. There’s a lovely story the comedian Julia Sweeney tells about her own journey from devout Catholicism to atheism. After she’d finally decided she was an atheist, something appeared about it in the newspaper. Her mother phoned her in hysterics and said something like “I don’t mind you not believing in God, but an atheist?” [_laughs_] The word bright was suggested by a California couple. I think it’s rather a good word, though most of my atheist friends think it suggests religious people are dims. I say, “What’s wrong with that?” [_laughs_]\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You’ve described yourself as a “tooth fairy” agnostic. What is that?\n\n**DAWKINS**: Rather than say he’s an atheist, a friend of mine says, “I’m a tooth fairy agnostic,” meaning he can’t disprove God but thinks God is about as likely as the tooth fairy.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: So you don’t completely rule out the idea of a supreme being. Critics see that as leaving an opening.\n\n**DAWKINS**: You can think so, if you think there’s an opening for the tooth fairy.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: It sounds like the argument made by Bertrand Russell, who said that while he could claim a teapot orbited the sun between Earth and Mars, he couldn’t expect anyone to believe him just because they couldn’t prove him wrong.\n\n**DAWKINS**: It’s the same idea. It’s a little unfair to say it’s like the tooth fairy. I think a particular god like Zeus or Jehovah is as unlikely as the tooth fairy, but the idea of some kind of creative intelligence is not quite so ridiculous.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: So you aren’t taking Pascal up on his wager. He was the 17th century philosopher who argued it’s a smarter bet to believe in God, because if you’re wrong——\n\n**DAWKINS**: The cost of failure is very high. But what if you choose the wrong god to believe in? What if you get up there and it’s not Jehovah but Baal? [laughs] And even if you pick the right god, why should God be so obsessive about you believing in him? Plus, any god worth its salt is going to realize you’re feigning. The odds are extremely low, but nevertheless it’s worth it because the reward is extremely high. But you may also be wasting your life. You go to church every Sunday, you do penance, you wear sackcloth and ashes. You have a horrible life, and then you die and that’s it.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Assume there is a god and you were given the chance to ask him one question. What would it be?\n\n**DAWKINS**: I’d ask, “Sir, why did you go to such lengths to hide yourself?”\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Do you have any deeply religious friends?\n\n**DAWKINS**: No. It’s not that I shun them; it’s that the circles I move in tend to be educated, intelligent circles, and there aren’t any religious people among them that I know of. I’m friendly with some bishops and vicars who kind of believe in something and enjoy the music and the stained glass.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking reference God in their writings. Are they using the word in the sense of an intelligent designer?\n\n**DAWKINS**: Certainly not. They use god in a poetic, metaphorical sense. Einstein in particular loved using the word to convey an idea of mystery, which I think all decent scientists do. But nowadays we’ve learned better than to use the word god because it will be willfully misunderstood, as Einstein was. And poor Einstein got quite cross about it. “I do not believe in a personal god,” he said over and over again. In a way he was asking for it. Hawking uses it in a similar way in A Brief History of Time. In his famous last line he says that if we understood the universe, “then we would know the mind of God.” Once again he is using god in the Einsteinian, not the religious sense. And so Hawking’s The Grand Design, in which he says the universe could have come from nothing, is not him turning away from God; his beliefs are exactly the same.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You’ve had a lot of fun deconstructing the idea of the intelligent designer. You point out that God made a cheetah fast enough to catch a gazelle and a gazelle fast enough to outrun a cheetah——\n\n**DAWKINS**: Yes. Is God a sadist?\n\n**PLAYBOY**: And bad design such as the fact we breathe and eat through the same tube, making it easy to choke to death.\n\n**DAWKINS**: Or the laryngeal nerve, which loops around an artery in the chest and then goes back up to the larynx.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Not very efficient.\n\n**DAWKINS**: Not in a giraffe, anyway.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You argue Christians worship a “created God.” Some Christians respond that their God isn’t created; he’s eternal.\n\n**DAWKINS**: You could say the same of the universe. You could say elephants support the world on their backs. There have always been elephants. I declare it by fiat.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: The attacks of 9/11 seemed to make you more militant about your atheism, as if you had finally lost patience.\n\n**DAWKINS**: There was a certain amount of that. A lot of people in the world felt a desire to stand up and be counted. Any suggestion of anti-Americanism in my mind vanished. Ich bin ein Amerikaner. Then George W. Bush destroyed that. But it was also an anti-Islamic and an antireligious moment for me because I was nauseated by the way the response to “Allahu Akbar” was “God is with us,” or whatever the Christians said—the sound of Christian leaders in America uniting in support of the force that led to the crisis in the first place.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You blame 9/11 on belief in the afterlife.\n\n**DAWKINS**: Yes. Normally when an aircraft is hijacked, there’s an assumption that the hijackers want to go on living. It changes the game if the hijackers look forward to death because it will get them into the best part of paradise.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You mean the part with the 72 virgins the Koran says await martyrs.\n\n**DAWKINS**: Right. Young men who are too unattractive to get a woman in the real world go for the ones in paradise. But my point is these people really believe what they say they believe, whereas most Christians don’t. If you talk to dying Christians, they aren’t looking forward to it.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: What will happen when you die?\n\n**DAWKINS**: Well, I shall either be buried or be cremated.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Funny. But without faith in an afterlife, in what do you take comfort in times of despair?\n\n**DAWKINS**: Human love and companionship. But in more thoughtful, cerebral moments, I take—comfort is not quite the right word, but I draw strength from reflecting on what a privilege it is to be alive and what a privilege it is to have a brain that’s capable in its limited way of understanding why I exist and of reveling in the beauty of the world and the beauty of the products of evolution. The magnificence of the universe and the sense of smallness that gives us in space and in geologically deep time is humbling but in a strangely comforting way. It’s nice to feel you’re part of a hugely bigger picture.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Are you concerned that your opponents might fake a deathbed conversion, as creationists have tried to do with Darwin?\n\n**DAWKINS**: What’s slightly more worrying is the Antony Flew effect. Flew was an atheistic British philosopher who had an old-age conversion. It seems he went gaga. You can’t guard against that.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: So if it happens we should assume you’ve lost it.\n\n**DAWKINS**: Yes. After my friend Christopher Hitchens was diagnosed with cancer, he was asked if he might have a conversion. He said that if he did, it wouldn’t be the real him. What’s rather wicked is when religious apologists exploit that, as they did in the case of Flew, who in his old age was persuaded to put his name to a book saying that he’d been converted to a form of deism. Not only did he not write the book, he didn’t even read it. [laughs]\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Your call for militant atheism is one reason you were featured as a character on an episode of South Park. The show’s creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, had been accused of being atheists, so they thought of the most militant atheist they could skewer.\n\n**DAWKINS**: It’s the only South Park episode I’ve seen. There was an attempt at something approaching satire in the idea of an imagined future in which different sects of atheists are fighting each other. But most of that episode was ridiculous in the sense that what they had the cartoon figure of me doing, like buggering the bald transvestite——\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Transsexual, actually.\n\n**DAWKINS**: Transsexual, okay. That isn’t satire because it has nothing to do with what I stand for. And the scatological part, where they had somebody throwing shit, which stuck to my forehead—that’s not even funny. I don’t understand why they couldn’t go straight to the atheists fighting each other, which has a certain amount of truth in it. It reminded me of the bit from Monty Python’s Life of Brian with the Judean People’s Front and the People’s Front of Judea.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: President Obama acknowledged “nonbelievers” in his inaugural address, which caused a fuss. But when you consider religious belief, one of the largest groups in the U.S. is atheists and agnostics. Why do they get overlooked in political discussions?\n\n**DAWKINS**: It’s a good point. Of course, it depends how you slice it. Christians are by far the largest group. If you divide Christians into denominations, agnostics and atheists come in third, behind Catholics and Baptists. That’s interesting when you contrast it with the lack of influence of nonbelievers. And if you count up the number of Jews, certainly observant Jews, it’s much smaller than the number of nonbelievers. Yet Jews have tremendous influence. I’m not criticizing that—bully for them. But we could do the same.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You’re not hopeful about peace between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\n**DAWKINS**: There’s not much hope to the extent that the most influential protagonists both base their hostility on 2,000-year-old books that they believe give them title to the land.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: What is your view of Jesus?\n\n**DAWKINS**: The evidence he existed is surprisingly shaky. The earliest books in the New Testament to be written were the Epistles, not the Gospels. It’s almost as though Saint Paul and others who wrote the Epistles weren’t that interested in whether Jesus was real. Even if he’s fictional, whoever wrote his lines was ahead of his time in terms of moral philosophy.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You’ve read the Bible.\n\n**DAWKINS**: I haven’t read it all, but my knowledge of the Bible is a lot better than most fundamentalist Christians’.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Do you have a favorite verse?\n\n**DAWKINS**: My favorite book is Ecclesiastes. It’s wonderful poetry in 17th century English, and I’m told it’s very good in the Hebrew. “Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.” The Song of Songs is terrific, and it’s more bawdy in the Hebrew, almost a drinking song.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You’ve made the point that if Jesus existed and went to his death as described in the Bible, it was, as you put it, “barking mad.”\n\n**DAWKINS**: There’s no evidence Jesus himself was barking mad, but the doctrine invented later by Paul that Jesus died for our sins surely is. It’s a truly disgusting idea that the creator of the universe—capable of inventing the laws of physics and designing the evolutionary process—that this protégé of supernatural intellect couldn’t think of a better way to forgive our sins than to have himself tortured to death. And what a terrible lesson to say we’re born in sin because of the original sin of Adam, a man even the Catholic Church now says never existed.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: We hear constantly that America is a Christian nation and that the founding fathers were all Christians.\n\n**DAWKINS**: They were deists. They didn’t believe in a personal god, or one who interferes in human affairs. And they were adamant that they did not want to found the United States as a Christian nation.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: But you hear quite often that if you let atheists run things you end up with Hitler and Stalin.\n\n**DAWKINS**: Hitler wasn’t an atheist; he was a Roman Catholic. But I don’t care what he was. There is no logical connection between atheism and doing bad things, nor good things for that matter. It’s a philosophical belief about the absence of a creative intelligence in the world. Anybody who thinks you need religion in order to be good is being good for the wrong reason. I’d rather be good for moral reasons. Morals were here before religion, and morals change rather rapidly in spite of religion. Even people who rely on the Bible use nonbiblical criteria. If your criteria are scriptural, you have no basis for choosing the verse that says turn the other cheek rather than the verse that says stone people to death. So you pick and choose without guidance from the Bible.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You’ve said that science is losing the war with religion.\n\n**DAWKINS**: Did I say we were losing? I was just having an off day.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You are surprised science is still being challenged.\n\n**DAWKINS**: I am surprised, but I’m not sure it’s a losing battle. If you take the long view of centuries, there’s an upward trend. Religious people like to point out that Isaac Newton was religious. Well, of course he was—he lived before Darwin. It would have been difficult to be an atheist before Darwin.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You might have been the guy who didn’t believe in Zeus.\n\n**DAWKINS**: I would have been skeptical of the details of Zeus hurling thunderbolts, but I probably would have believed in some supernatural being. When you look around at the living world and see the complexity of a cell and the elegance of a tree—“I think that I shall never see / A poem lovely as a tree. / Poems are made by fools like me, / But only God can make a tree”—I would have been moved by that. Darwin changed all that. He provided a simple, explicable, workable story about how you can get the complexity not just of a tree but of a human by physics working through the rather special process of evolution by natural selection. If only Newton had been alive to be told about that.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: The evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould viewed science and religion as——\n\n**DAWKINS**: Non-overlapping magisteria, or NOMA.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Completely separate.\n\n**DAWKINS**: That’s pure politics. Gould was trying to win battles in the creation-evolution debate by saying to religious people, “You don’t have to worry. Evolution is religion-friendly.” And the only way he could think to do that was to say they occupy separate domains. But he overgenerously handed the domains of morals and fundamental questions to religion, which is the last thing you should do. Science cannot at present—maybe never—answer the deep questions about existence and the origins of the fundamental laws of nature. But what on earth makes you think religion can? If science can’t provide an answer, nothing can.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Some scientists say that you should stop talking about atheism because it muddies the waters in the debate over evolution.\n\n**DAWKINS**: If what you’re trying to do is win the tactical battle in U.S. schools, you’re better off lying and saying evolution is religion-friendly. I don’t wish to condemn people who lie for tactical reasons, but I don’t want to do that. For me, this is only a skirmish in the larger war against irrationality.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You’ve said that if science and religion are truly NOMA, Christians must give up their belief in miracles.\n\n**DAWKINS**: Absolutely. Miracles are a naked encroachment on science’s turf. If you ask people in the pew or on the prayer mat why they believe in God, it will always involve miracles, including the miracle of creation. If you don’t allow religion to have that, you’ve removed the reason just about everybody who is religious is religious.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Do you get discouraged by the continuing attacks on reason?\n\n**DAWKINS**: No. I go on the internet quite a lot and read what young people are saying. I see a great upsurge of good sense, rationality, irreverence. America is split into halves. There’s the Sarah Palin know-nothing idiots on the one hand, and then there’s a huge number of intellectual, intelligent, educated people on the other. I find it hard to believe that the Stone Age types are going to win in the end. An awful lot of people who call themselves religious simply don’t know there’s any alternative. If you probe what they believe, it turns out to be pretty much the same—we all have a sense of wonder and reverence at the majesty of the universe.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You’re of the mind that religious belief probably evolved as an “accidental by-product.”\n\n**DAWKINS**: Whenever something is widespread in a species, you have to reckon it has some sort of survival value. There’s probably no survival value in religion itself—though there might be—but value in lots of rather separate psychological predispositions such as obedience to authority. That has strong survival value for children. Because they’re helpless and don’t know their way around the world, they rely on parental wisdom. But they don’t have the means of distinguishing wisdom that is wise for survival from wisdom that is nonsense.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Your parents raised you in the Anglican church.\n\n**DAWKINS**: I wouldn’t wish to malign my parents by suggesting they fed me religion. I was sent to some of the best schools, and as most such schools in England were at the time, they were Anglican schools. So I got daily prayers and Bible readings. I was confirmed at 13.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: When did you first read Darwin’s On the Origin of Species?\n\n**DAWKINS**: Two years later.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: And it blew your mind.\n\n**DAWKINS**: Yes. That such a simple idea could explain the complexities of a peacock’s tail, a bounding antelope, a sprinting cheetah, a flying swift, a thinking human. These are immensely complicated machines, and yet we understand why they’re here.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Your parents were naturalists who you’ve said could identify every plant in Britain.\n\n**DAWKINS**: My father read botany at Oxford. I read zoology there. I wasn’t a naturalist in the way he was, but I loved going around the jungle with somebody who knew about it.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Is there any particular way he influenced you?\n\n**DAWKINS**: Curiosity, scientific curiosity.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: How about your mother?\n\n**DAWKINS**: She didn’t do a degree in science, but she had a very good knowledge of plants as well. I guess that’s one of the things they did together. She educated me as a child, and I learned a great deal from her.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You were born in Nairobi. Why were your parents there?\n\n**DAWKINS**: Because of his botanical background, my father joined the agricultural department of the Colonial Civil Service and was sent to East Africa, to what was then Nyasaland and is now Malawi. Then he was called up to join the King’s African Rifles, which was the British regiment headquartered in Nairobi. So he went up north to Kenya and my mother followed. She had a certain amount of trouble. Since she wasn’t in Kenya legally, it was quite difficult getting out. [laughs]\n\n**PLAYBOY**: What do you remember about that time?\n\n**DAWKINS**: I remember a lot about Nyasaland. I remember the smells and sights and colors. It was a privileged existence, with servants. It was like setting the clock back 100 years; it was a strange paternalistic society we lived in.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: When you were eight you moved with your parents to England.\n\n**DAWKINS**: My father was left the Dawkins estate, which had been in the family since 1723, by a very distant cousin—so distant we’d never heard of him. This cousin wanted the farm to stay with a Dawkins, but everyone had daughters. It was a brilliant choice because my father was qualified in agriculture, albeit tropical, and had the right kind of enterprising mind to turn what had been a country gentleman’s estate into a working farm.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: What did he grow?\n\n**DAWKINS**: We had Jersey cows, which as you know make a lot of cream. He supplied all the local hotels and the Oxford colleges with cream. And pigs. The acreage isn’t that great. An eccentric Dawkins of the 19th century sold off most of the land to pay for lawsuits, so most of the family wealth disappeared.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Decades after moving to England, you wrote your first book during a blackout.\n\n**DAWKINS**: In 1972 there was major industrial unrest in Britain, and for whole days there would be no power. I couldn’t do my research, so I started writing The Selfish Gene.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You’re a great fan of science fiction. What do you like about it?\n\n**DAWKINS**: I prefer science fiction that takes some aspect of science and modifies it. There’s a lovely novel by Daniel Galouye called Dark Universe, about a group of people who live in total darkness and know nothing about light. And so light has become a mythology. They use phrases like “Great Light Almighty” and have ceremonies when they feel a sacred lightbulb. Galouye changed one thing—he removed light—and looked at all the consequences.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: As opposed to creating a fairyland.\n\n**DAWKINS**: Princesses riding unicorns isn’t science fiction.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: The Playboy Advisor received this question from a reader: “I feel uncomfortable when a person I just met asks me whether I go to church, because I don’t. Is there an etiquette to answering?”\n\n**DAWKINS**: I would reply, “No, I do not go to church. Do you, and if so, why?”\n\n**PLAYBOY**: That’s what you advised your daughter in a letter you wrote her when she was 10.\n\n**DAWKINS**: What I did, and what I would tell other parents to do, is encourage her to think for herself. As an illustration, for Santa I said, “Well, let’s work out how many chimneys there are.” I mean, it would be a fun game where we calculate that he would have to be traveling faster than the speed of light.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: What if the child bursts into tears?\n\n**DAWKINS**: Oh, that would be a shame.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Did having a child change your outlook in any way?\n\n**DAWKINS**: I don’t think so, though I’m interested in the evolutionary origins of subjective feelings. I became palpably more nervous about things like heights.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You saw danger everywhere.\n\n**DAWKINS**: That’s right.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You advised her that anytime someone presented her with a claim, she should ask, “What is the evidence?” Was she popular with her teachers?\n\n**DAWKINS**: I don’t know about her, but I have heard horror stories about children who asked too many questions of teachers of religion.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: All the atheists we met at the skeptics convention in Las Vegas seemed to have a story about being kicked out of Sunday school.\n\n**DAWKINS**: Yes, that’s terribly funny. What a Sunday school teacher should say is “Let’s look at the evidence.” Instead they get cross. And the reason they get cross is that there isn’t any evidence.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: They get cross with you as well. You are asking a religious person to change his or her worldview.\n\n**DAWKINS**: I want people to change their worldview such that they demand evidence for something they’re going to believe. It’s not a good reason to believe because “our people have always believed that.” If you’d been born in Afghanistan or India, you’d believe something else. Another lousy reason is because you have an inner feeling it must be true, or you’ve been told by a priest it’s true.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Ken Miller, author of Finding Darwin’s God, once scolded you by saying atheists and agnostics are more evangelical than religious people. Is that your experience with atheists?\n\n**DAWKINS**: You can be passionate about the need to look at the evidence and passionately angry at people who won’t do that. That’s not evangelical; that’s just angry.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You like Miller’s book, though.\n\n**DAWKINS**: It may well be the best refutation of creationism, though it goes off the rails when it tries to justify Christianity. One of the reasons I recommend it is not just because it’s good but because it is written by a Christian. Unfortunately it’s written by a Catholic, and many of the people we’re talking about think Catholics are worse than atheists. [laughs]\n\n**PLAYBOY**: In 2010 you spoke at a rally in London to protest a state visit by Pope Benedict XVI.\n\n**DAWKINS**: Only about 2,000 people were expected, and 15,000 turned up.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You dismissed the pope as an enemy of children, gay people, women, truth, poor people, science and humanity.\n\n**DAWKINS**: It was a speech at a rally, so I used rhetoric.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Do you believe, as Christopher Hitchens did, that the pope should be arrested?\n\n**DAWKINS**: Hitchens wrote me suggesting we should arrest him, but we soon gave up on the idea of literally making a citizen’s arrest by creeping up with handcuffs or something. Instead we asked Geoffrey Robertson, a distinguished human rights lawyer, to speak about the legal case against the pope for covering up pedophilia. He also looked at the alleged immunity of the pope from prosecution as the head of a state, calling into question the notion of the Vatican as a legitimate sovereign state. I responded to the pope’s uncalled-for truculence when he landed in Edinburgh. The first thing he said was to blame atheists for Hitler. Although I don’t blame the pope for being a member of the Hitler Youth, as he was very young, I felt this was pretty cheeky, really. If I were him I’d keep my head down over Hitler.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You were impressed by a few of the signs at the rally.\n\n**DAWKINS**: Two of my favorites were keep your rosaries off my ovaries and hands off my eggs, benedict. [laughs]\n\n**PLAYBOY**: The pope apologized for the sexual abuse of children in the Catholic church. Isn’t that enough?\n\n**DAWKINS**: Oh, big deal. He hasn’t handed over any records to the police. He apologized with great reluctance after enormous pressure was brought to bear.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You gave a speech in Dublin in which you argued that sexual abuse is less damaging to a child than the psychological damage of bringing him up Catholic. What was the response?\n\n**DAWKINS**: I got an ovation. I want to make clear I was not talking about the sort of violent sexual abuse we’ve now learned had been repeatedly going on. I was talking about mild caressing, which is bad enough, but bringing up a child to believe in hellfire is worse.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Let’s turn to evolution, which many people misunderstand, such as believing we descend from apes.\n\n**DAWKINS**: We are apes. We descend from extinct animals that would have been classified as apes. We are not descended from modern chimps or bonobos or gorillas. They’ve been evolving for exactly the same length of time as we have.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: So what makes us human?\n\n**DAWKINS**: We are a unique ape. We have language. Other animals have systems of communication that fall far short of that. They don’t have the same ability to communicate complicated conditionals and what-ifs and talk about things that are not present. These are all unique manifestations of our evolved ape brain, which some evidence suggests came about through a rather limited number of mutations.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Peter Singer, who co-founded the Great Ape Project, suggests apes deserve basic rights. Do you agree?\n\n**DAWKINS**: Why stop at apes? Why not pigs?\n\n**PLAYBOY**: But apes are our cousins.\n\n**DAWKINS**: So what? We’re all cousins. What if octopuses, which are much more distant cousins, had evolved an intelligence equivalent to ours?\n\n**PLAYBOY**: But they didn’t.\n\n**DAWKINS**: You can base your morals on kinship if you want, but why should you? I’d prefer to go with Jeremy Bentham and base my morals on the question, Can they suffer? Singer’s rather keen on the word speciesism. We have a common ancestor with chimps who lived 6 million years ago. If you imagine holding the hand of your mother, who holds the hand of her mother, who holds the hand of her mother, and you go on and on to the common ancestor, the line would stretch a few hundred miles. And in its other hand the grand ancestor holds her daughter’s hand who holds her daughter’s hand, and you go forward to modern chimps. As you go back, every one of those mother-daughter relationships would include members of the same species.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: So there was no first human.\n\n**DAWKINS**: No, never. But suppose an intermediate species hadn’t gone extinct. Suppose relict populations are discovered in the African jungle. In order to deny chimpanzees rights, you would have to set up apartheid-like courts to decide whether this individual counts as human. Because it’s a continuum. As a practical matter, the intermediates haven’t survived, so it’s possible to give humans basic rights and give chimpanzees none. But I think it’s a worthwhile argument.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Are you pro-life?\n\n**DAWKINS**: People who say they’re pro-life mean they are pro-human life. A four-cell embryo or a 64-cell embryo, or indeed one much larger than that, has no nervous system. You should have rather less compunction in killing such a creature than you would in killing an earthworm, because an earthworm has a nervous system and very likely can suffer. So objecting to the abortion of very young human embryos is utter nonsense. Objecting to older human embryos being killed is not utter nonsense. There’s no reason to suppose that their capacity to suffer is any greater than the capacity of an adult pig or cow to suffer.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Do we know which came first—bigger brains or bipedalism?\n\n**DAWKINS**: Bipedalism came first.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: How do we know that?\n\n**DAWKINS**: Fossils. That’s one place the fossils are extremely clear. Three million years ago Australopithecus afarensis were bipedal, but their brains were no bigger than a chimpanzee’s. The best example we have is Lucy [a partial skeleton found in 1974 in Ethiopia]. In a way, she was an upright-walking chimpanzee.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You like Lucy.\n\n**DAWKINS**: Yes. [smiles]\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You’ve said you expect mankind will have a genetic book of the dead by 2050. How would that be helpful?\n\n**DAWKINS**: Because we contain within us the genes that have survived through generations, you could theoretically read off a creature’s evolutionary history. “Ah, yes, this animal lived in the sea. This is the time when it lived in deserts. This bit shows it must have lived up mountains. And this shows it used to burrow.”\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Could that help us bring back a dinosaur? You have suggested crossing a bird and a crocodile and maybe putting it in an ostrich egg.\n\n**DAWKINS**: It would have to be more sophisticated than a cross. It’d have to be a merging.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Could we re-create Lucy?\n\n**DAWKINS**: We already know the human genome and the chimpanzee genome, so you could make a sophisticated guess as to what the genome of the common ancestor might have been like. From that you might be able to grow an animal that was close to the common ancestor. And from that you might split the difference between that ancestral animal you re-created and a modern human and get Lucy.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You’ve accused creationists of fighting dirty.\n\n**DAWKINS**: Sure they do.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Is that why you and other evolutionary biologists won’t debate them?\n\n**DAWKINS**: Partly. It also gives them a respectability they don’t deserve. A colleague of mine likes to respond, “That would look great on your CV, not so good on mine.”\n\n**PLAYBOY**: What arguments do creationists typically hit you with?\n\n**DAWKINS**: Ignorant nonsense. They say things like “Well, if we’re descended from chimpanzees, how come chimpanzees are still around?” It isn’t difficult.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You often hear evolution described as “just a theory.” Is it?\n\n**DAWKINS**: The word theory can mean a hypothesis. But the word is also used in a more serious sense as a body of knowledge. It’s better to use the word fact. Evolution is a fact in the same sense that the earth orbits the sun.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: There is disagreement about what drives evolution.\n\n**DAWKINS**: Natural selection is the driving force, but there is disagreement about what the selection pressure was. For example, we know the human brain grew bigger. Was it because the more ingenious individuals were the best at finding food or evading predators? Or was it because they were the most sexually attractive? It’s possible an enlarged brain is rather like a peacock’s tail. Darwin proposed a second version of natural selection, which he called sexual selection. If peahens choose peacocks for the brightness of their finery, then never mind about surviving. The ones with the biggest tails survive less well, because the tail is a burden. Nevertheless if they’re more attractive to females, then the genes for making big tails are more likely to end up in the next generation. It is quite possible the human brain also got bigger due to sexual selection. Intelligence is sexy. Maybe the most intelligent males had the gift of the gab. They may have been good talkers, good at remembering the sagas and myths of the tribe, or dance steps.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Or that she likes antelope.\n\n**DAWKINS**: Something like that. If a peahen chooses a male with a long tail, it’s because she knows he couldn’t have survived with a tail like that unless he had something going for him. It’s all about showing females you are resistant to disease. There’s a dual selection—females become better diagnostic doctors, and males become better at being diagnosed, even if they’re actually ill.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: What role does chance play in evolution?\n\n**DAWKINS**: Mutation, the raw material for natural selection, is random in the sense that it is not systematically directed toward improvement. But natural selection is highly nonrandom, because it’s choosing improvements from that pool of variation that mutation throws up. There’s also an awful lot of chance in which species go extinct. When a comet hit the earth, all the dinosaurs went extinct except birds. A few mammals survived, and we’re descended from those few mammals, perhaps those that were hibernating underground.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: You’ve described life as a “replication bomb.”\n\n**DAWKINS**: If you look around the universe, there’s dead world after dead world. Physics goes on and chemistry goes on, but nothing else happens. And suddenly in one place there’s an explosion, which comes about because of replication. For some reason, the laws of chemistry give rise to a molecule that self-replicates. Maybe this planet is the only time it’s ever happened. But the arising through some accident of chemistry of a molecule that makes copies of itself has momentous consequences.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Creationists often try to ambush you, such as the Australian film crew that hit you with “Can you give me an example of a genetic mutation or an evolutionary process that can be seen to increase the information in the genome?” and then, because you paused, portrayed you as not having an answer.\n\n**DAWKINS**: The way it happens is through gene duplication. You have lengths of the genome that do some useful thing, and then a chunk gets copied and pasted somewhere else, where it’s free to evolve in a different direction.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: So why didn’t you respond?\n\n**DAWKINS**: I was thinking, Am I going to throw these people out? This is a question only a creationist would ask, and they hadn’t told me they were creationists. What they did was splice the question and the long pause with my answer to a different question, so it looked as though I was being evasive. It was an absolutely scandalous piece of mendacity.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Most objections to evolution seem to come down to complexity. People can’t understand how something like an eye could have evolved.\n\n**DAWKINS**: No matter how complex the eye may be, it’s not as complicated as a god.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Creationists love to cite gaps in the fossil record, such as the large one that precedes the Cambrian explosion, the period about 530 million years ago during which there was exponential growth in complex life-forms. How can you explain it?\n\n**DAWKINS**: Of course there are gaps; fossilization is a rare event. But if we didn’t have a single fossil, the evidence for evolution would be absolutely secure because of comparative anatomy, comparative biochemistry, geographical distribution. The gap before the Cambrian explosion is interesting because it’s a big one. But if you think about it, there are major groups of animals that have no fossils. For example, today we saw in the natural history museum an almost microscopic creature called a tardigrade. They don’t fossilize because they’re soft. Presumably before the Cambrian, most of the ancestors of the Cambrian creatures were soft and small.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: How do we know they existed if there are no fossils?\n\n**DAWKINS**: That’s not quite the right question, is it? Their descendants existed in the Cambrian, so unless you seriously think they were created in the Cambrian, they must have existed. You may say that’s not evidence, and I’m saying you could say the same of any soft creature for which we have no fossils. How do we know it wasn’t created in 1800? It doesn’t make sense.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: What about this one, another favorite of creationists: If modern animals such as monkeys evolved from frogs, why haven’t we found any fossils from a transitional creature such as a fronkey?\n\n**DAWKINS**: The fallacy is thinking of modern animals as descended from other modern animals. If you take that seriously, there should be not just fronkey fossils but crocoduck or octocow fossils. Why on earth would you expect you could take any pair of animals and look for a combination of them? We’re looking at the tips of the twigs of the tree. The ancestors are buried deep in the middle, in the crown of the tree. There are no fronkeys because the common ancestor of a frog and a monkey would be some kind of fishy, salamandery thing that looks like neither a frog nor a monkey.\n\n**PLAYBOY**: Creationists are fond of arguing that if you remove one part and it doesn’t work, then there’s no way it could have evolved.\n\n**DAWKINS**: Quite a good analogy here is an arch, where you have stone, stone, stone, and then it meets in the middle and stands up. But take away any one part and it collapses. You might think it’s difficult to build an arch until you have the whole thing in place, but you’re not considering that they used scaffolding, which has since been taken down. That’s one answer. Another is to point out that you don’t need all the bits of an eye in order to see. You can have a very imperfect eye that can see only the difference between light and dark. That’s still useful if you can see the shadow of a predator. So it’s not true that half an eye is not useful. Half an eye is half as good as a whole eye, and it’s better than nothing.\n","updated":1414378977000,"excerpt":"<p><a href=\"http://fak3r.com/2012/08/20/playboy-interview-richard-dawkins/scarlet_a/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\"><img src=\"http://fak3r.com/assets/scarlet_A.png\" alt=\"The Out Campaign  \"></a> The Out Campaign logo</p>\n<p>Today I read the recent interview with Richard Dawkins, the English ethologist, evolutionary biologist and the worlds best known atheist, on Playboy.com, and as always found his candor enjoyable and refreshing.

While I’m not part of the network team, they asked me to do this because of my prior experience and interest in such things.  The idea of this was to be a temporary fix until they get a new line installed providing greater bandwidth, but my argument is for the continuation of this segmentation even after the new line is installed.  Below is a slightly sanitized version of my arguments for this.  Note that my thoughts and comments are driven by years of running networks, thus it is something I care about and have spent years thinking about, so it is wordy.  I’d be very happy to discuss this, or other solutions, via the comments below because I never want to stop learning.</em></p>\n<p>I’d like to share my thoughts in as to why I think the network is better served with keeping internal traffic and public traffic separate.  Regardless of if you use the existing web proxy server, or another one with different network topology, I care less about the tool, and more about making the network and user experience better for both internal and external users<a id=\"more\"></a><em>**</em></p>\n<p><strong>integrity</strong><br>First off, my strong feeling is that internal users should <em>never</em> be able to effect the performance of production websites (and to a slightly lessor extent vice versa).  Say for example we have a virus that bounces from email to email and sends out spurious requests via the Internet, this hammers our local network which kills the integrity of our production websites.  External users are left with an unusable system, and our integrity suffers.  On the flip side, a PR announcement goes out and traffic to our production sites surges, making not only our production sites slow, but also the local network for users trying to get email and look up things on-line.  Having all of these resources straining the same bandwidth pipe puts other things such as credit card verifications for sales in direct competition with a YouTube video download by an employee.  Sure a packet shaper can set priority for the credit card line, but why even have the competition?  Having these two types of traffic segmented from the start is a must to keep the integrity of our network, and our production running as well as they can without the chance of either one negatively effecting the other.  Additionally this setup cascades down to effect the other following aspects of how our network performs.  They are…</p>\n<p><strong>security</strong><br>I’ve always been of the mindset that by default incoming ports are always set at “deny everything, allow only what is needed”, something that virtually every firewall follows.  For the same reasons this should be the default behavior for any traffic originating here and heading out via the outgoing ports.  As far as I could tell, under the old gateway configuration, everything was allowed out (aside: even some protocols that people on the network side told me were blocked, were simply not) with the new gateway everything outbound was initially denied, and then we only opened things that ‘needed’ to be open.  In doing this we’ve shut down 1000s of ports that could otherwise be available for malicious program to utilize to breach our security from inside.  This is often how malware and viruses communicate their successful infestation and request further instructions.  Additionally, having a web proxy often stops this kind of communication because even a simple HTTP request initiated by the malware will not be configured to transmit through a web proxy; it will be expecting a straight shot out, since that’s far more common.  This is one of the benefits of a traditional proxy over a so called ‘transparent’ proxy where no configuration is needed for the client to communicate externally; with a traditional proxy the malware will not know how it needs to be configured to transmit through the proxy.</p>\n<p><strong>bandwidth</strong><br>A reverse proxy works by checking an HTTP request from a user against a cache of recently requested objects that the proxy stores.  This saves bandwidth since if a stored object (think of a file like a graphic, css, javascript, etc) is found it can be used instead of making another external request and download.  The current web proxy/gateway includes this functionality using the industry standard Squid, with no maintenance required.  It’s simply better utilizing the resources automatically, so its use is a no brain-er here.  If we ultimately drop the web proxy I’m still going to be of the opinion that running a standalone reverse proxy like Squid, or my choice Varnish, would save incoming and outgoing bandwidth on our network.</p>\n<p><strong>transparency</strong><br>While we got into this exercise because the network was slow; it was slow for internal users and slow for external users.  Now it’s fast for internal users, with plenty of headroom to spare, and it will never infringe upon external users.  Any slowness of our sites can now be diagnosed without the concern of unknown network traffic effecting its abilities thus making troubleshooting and managing much simpler.  If we went back to the ‘everyone in the same pool’ setup, we’ll be at the same mercy the next time the network is slow - how will we troubleshoot it then?  Pull the external users onto a new proxy so we can segment them out as a cause of the slowness?  With the network segmented we can already rule out one type of traffic being the cause of slowness.</p>\n<p><strong>simplicity </strong><br>While a web proxy/firewall solution can be complex, the gateway in place is running Smoothwall, a specialized Linux install that is administrated fully through a web user interface.  It’s simple to use and administrate as it is very well documented.  If I were to leave tomorrow I have no reservations that someone in the networking department could pick this up and run with it, no problem.  Other proxy solutions should be considered which could preform the same role with a similar level usability and upkeep.

it will be expecting a straight shot out, since that's far more common.  This is one of the benefits of a traditional proxy over a so called 'transparent' proxy where no configuration is needed for the client to communicate externally; with a traditional proxy the malware will not know how it needs to be configured to transmit through the proxy.\n\n**bandwidth**\nA reverse proxy works by checking an HTTP request from a user against a cache of recently requested objects that the proxy stores.  This saves bandwidth since if a stored object (think of a file like a graphic, css, javascript, etc) is found it can be used instead of making another external request and download.  The current web proxy/gateway includes this functionality using the industry standard Squid, with no maintenance required.  It's simply better utilizing the resources automatically, so its use is a no brain-er here.  If we ultimately drop the web proxy I'm still going to be of the opinion that running a standalone reverse proxy like Squid, or my choice Varnish, would save incoming and outgoing bandwidth on our network.\n\n**transparency**\nWhile we got into this exercise because the network was slow; it was slow for internal users and slow for external users.  Now it's fast for internal users, with plenty of headroom to spare, and it will never infringe upon external users.  Any slowness of our sites can now be diagnosed without the concern of unknown network traffic effecting its abilities thus making troubleshooting and managing much simpler.  If we went back to the 'everyone in the same pool' setup, we'll be at the same mercy the next time the network is slow - how will we troubleshoot it then?  Pull the external users onto a new proxy so we can segment them out as a cause of the slowness?  With the network segmented we can already rule out one type of traffic being the cause of slowness.\n\n**simplicity **\nWhile a web proxy/firewall solution can be complex, the gateway in place is running Smoothwall, a specialized Linux install that is administrated fully through a web user interface.  It's simple to use and administrate as it is very well documented.  If I were to leave tomorrow I have no reservations that someone in the networking department could pick this up and run with it, no problem.  Other proxy solutions should be considered which could preform the same role with a similar level usability and upkeep.  The point is, we can do complex network configuration to best utilize our resources without having a specialist on hand to administrate it.\n\n**conclusion**\nI've installed a solution here that works at improving the network in a myriad of ways, and is doing the job without any day to day maintenance, however I would not be offended if another solution was suggested and used over mine.  My concern is not only for our network performance, but how our presence is perceived externally to the world as far as providing useful, reliable resources for information.\n\nExtra credit for reading all the way to the bottom, and regardless of what decision is made, thanks for allowing me to present my solution, and my rational for it.\n","updated":1414378977000,"excerpt":"<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>at work I installed a web proxy to separate internal user traffic from external traffic hitting our prod__uction servers.

Essentially, an LSID is a unique identifier for some data, and the LSID protocol specifies a standard way to locate the data (as well as a standard way of describing that data). They are a little like DOIs used by many publishers.</em>“  I posted my thoughts to the <a href=\"http://tdwg.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">TDWG</a> discussion mailing list on the topic, and am reprinting it here to allow for further community commentary; <a href=\"http://code4lib.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Code4lib</a>, I’m looking at you.  While much of it is theoretical, it is doable, and if it covers all that needs to be addressed, would be a cool, sustainable way forward for link resolvers for all kinds of usage.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’m with Tim on this one, and taking one of Rod’s other posts (“<a href=\"http://iphylo.blogspot.com/2009/04/lsids-disaster-or-opportunity.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">LSIDs, disaster or opportunity</a>“) a bit further, I think coming up with a simple, extend-able URL resolver would give us many benefits and allow LSIDs with extra, added information around them for all to use.  Looking at his example, a URL would get permanent tracking that would also post referrers, location and traffic.  A summary of the link could even be a page in itself, a cached version, a screenshot, or just a scrape of the code - pulling out the HTML tags, for future reference in case the real link goes down.  We could use the ability to create a customizable prefix (ie- <a href=\"http://someresolvr.com/bhl/SDFoijF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://someresolvr.com/bhl/SDFoijF</a>), to somewhat follow DOI conventions, but could even save old DOIs or handles for historical purposes in a field attached to the new URL, or for reuse, making the new URL resolve to a current DOI with a simple post at the end of the new URL (ie- <a href=\"http://someresolvr.com/bhl/SDFoijF/DOI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://someresolvr.com/bhl/SDFoijF/DOI</a>).  In the same way we could use user input, data pulled about the URL semantically to generate RDFa  (by using <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2007/08/pyRdfa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">pyRdfa</a>), then exposing that for all newly created URLS, and coming up with a standard to make it predictable (ie- <a href=\"http://someresolvr.com/bhl/SDFoijF/RDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://someresolvr.com/bhl/SDFoijF/RDF</a>).  The example at bit.ly shows the use of <a href=\"http://opencalais.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Open Calais</a> to get more background information on the original link to provide more information, but it could also be pointed to other services we provide/use in biodiversity to provide a snapshot across the board of more context/content.  Users of the service could login to examine/add/edit the data by hand if desired, so they would still retain ultimate control over how their record is presented.  Thus, from a simple URL, we could build a complete summary that would build on what we’re given while sharing it all back out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then the architecture (aka, the fun part) would be simple and distributed.  A webserver able to process PHP, running the database <a href=\"http://couchdb.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">CouchDB</a> would be all that is needed to run the resolver.  CouchDB is schema-less, so the way it handles replication is very simple, and is built to be distributed, only handing out the bits that have changed during replication, as well as scale in this manner.  Having a batch of main servers behind a URL in a pooled setup (think of a simplified/smaller version of the Pool of Unix <a href=\"http://www.pool.ntp.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">networked time servers</a>) would allow a round-robin DNS, or a <a href=\"http://www.ucarp.org/project/ucarp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">ucarp</a> setup (“<em>urcarp allows a couple of hosts to share common virtual IP addresses in order to provide automatic failover</em>“), so if one main server went down, another would automatically take over, without the user needing to change the URL.  Plus, if we wanted to, to battle heavy usage of the main servers we could use the idea of Primary and Secondary servers as outlined in the pool.ntp.org model, so an institution with heavy usage could become a Secondary host and run their own resolver simply, with almost no maintenance.  They would just need the PHP files, which would be a versioned project, and then have a cron task to replicate the database from a pool of the main servers.  The institution’s resolver could be customized to appear as their own, (ie- <a href=\"http://someresolvr.bhl.org/bhl/SDFoijF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://someresolvr.bhl.org/bhl/SDFoijF</a>) and for simplicity could be read-only.  This way a link like <a href=\"http://someresolvr.com/bhl/SDFoijF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://someresolvr.com/bhl/SDFoijF</a> could be resolvable against any institution’s server, like <a href=\"http://someresolvr.bhl.org/bhl/SDFoijF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://someresolvr.bhl.org/bhl/SDFoijF</a> or <a href=\"http://someresolvr.ebio.org/bhl/SDFoijF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://someresolvr.ebio.org/bhl/SDFoijF</a> - as all of the databases would be the same, although maybe a day behind, depending on the replication schedule.  New entries would only be entered on a main server, or in ‘the pool’ (ie- <a href=\"http://pool.someresolvr.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://pool.someresolvr.com/</a>), then those changes would be in the database to be handed out to all on the next replication (I won’t add my P2P ideas in this email - it may not be needed for the deltas that would need to be transfered daily or weekly).   Add to all of this that CouchDB is designed as “<em>…a distributed, fault-tolerant and schema-free document-oriented database</em>“ which would fit into what we want to do; build a store of documents (data) about a URL that we can serve, while being a permanent, sustainable resolver to the original document.  If the service ever died, it could be resurrected from anyone’s copy of the database (think <a href=\"http://www.lockss.org/lockss/Home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">LOCKSS</a> (Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe)), so that no data (original or accumulated) would be lost.

Essentially, an LSID is a unique identifier for some data, and the LSID protocol specifies a standard way to locate the data (as well as a standard way of describing that data). They are a little like DOIs used by many publishers._\"  I posted my thoughts to the [TDWG](http://tdwg.org) discussion mailing list on the topic, and am reprinting it here to allow for further community commentary; [Code4lib](http://code4lib.org), I'm looking at you.  While much of it is theoretical, it is doable, and if it covers all that needs to be addressed, would be a cool, sustainable way forward for link resolvers for all kinds of usage.\n\n\n> I'm with Tim on this one, and taking one of Rod's other posts (\"[LSIDs, disaster or opportunity](http://iphylo.blogspot.com/2009/04/lsids-disaster-or-opportunity.html)\") a bit further, I think coming up with a simple, extend-able URL resolver would give us many benefits and allow LSIDs with extra, added information around them for all to use.  Looking at his example, a URL would get permanent tracking that would also post referrers, location and traffic.  A summary of the link could even be a page in itself, a cached version, a screenshot, or just a scrape of the code - pulling out the HTML tags, for future reference in case the real link goes down.  We could use the ability to create a customizable prefix (ie- http://someresolvr.com/bhl/SDFoijF), to somewhat follow DOI conventions, but could even save old DOIs or handles for historical purposes in a field attached to the new URL, or for reuse, making the new URL resolve to a current DOI with a simple post at the end of the new URL (ie- http://someresolvr.com/bhl/SDFoijF/DOI).  In the same way we could use user input, data pulled about the URL semantically to generate RDFa  (by using [pyRdfa](http://www.w3.org/2007/08/pyRdfa/)), then exposing that for all newly created URLS, and coming up with a standard to make it predictable (ie- http://someresolvr.com/bhl/SDFoijF/RDF).  The example at bit.ly shows the use of [Open Calais](http://opencalais.com/) to get more background information on the original link to provide more information, but it could also be pointed to other services we provide/use in biodiversity to provide a snapshot across the board of more context/content.  Users of the service could login to examine/add/edit the data by hand if desired, so they would still retain ultimate control over how their record is presented.  Thus, from a simple URL, we could build a complete summary that would build on what we're given while sharing it all back out.\n\nThen the architecture (aka, the fun part) would be simple and distributed.  A webserver able to process PHP, running the database [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) would be all that is needed to run the resolver.  CouchDB is schema-less, so the way it handles replication is very simple, and is built to be distributed, only handing out the bits that have changed during replication, as well as scale in this manner.  Having a batch of main servers behind a URL in a pooled setup (think of a simplified/smaller version of the Pool of Unix [networked time servers](http://www.pool.ntp.org/)) would allow a round-robin DNS, or a [ucarp](http://www.ucarp.org/project/ucarp) setup (\"_urcarp allows a couple of hosts to share common virtual IP addresses in order to provide automatic failover_\"), so if one main server went down, another would automatically take over, without the user needing to change the URL.  Plus, if we wanted to, to battle heavy usage of the main servers we could use the idea of Primary and Secondary servers as outlined in the pool.ntp.org model, so an institution with heavy usage could become a Secondary host and run their own resolver simply, with almost no maintenance.  They would just need the PHP files, which would be a versioned project, and then have a cron task to replicate the database from a pool of the main servers.  The institution's resolver could be customized to appear as their own, (ie- http://someresolvr.bhl.org/bhl/SDFoijF) and for simplicity could be read-only.  This way a link like http://someresolvr.com/bhl/SDFoijF could be resolvable against any institution's server, like http://someresolvr.bhl.org/bhl/SDFoijF or http://someresolvr.ebio.org/bhl/SDFoijF - as all of the databases would be the same, although maybe a day behind, depending on the replication schedule.  New entries would only be entered on a main server, or in 'the pool' (ie- http://pool.someresolvr.com/), then those changes would be in the database to be handed out to all on the next replication (I won't add my P2P ideas in this email - it may not be needed for the deltas that would need to be transfered daily or weekly).   Add to all of this that CouchDB is designed as \"_...a distributed, fault-tolerant and schema-free document-oriented database_\" which would fit into what we want to do; build a store of documents (data) about a URL that we can serve, while being a permanent, sustainable resolver to the original document.  If the service ever died, it could be resurrected from anyone's copy of the database (think [LOCKSS](http://www.lockss.org/lockss/Home) (Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe)), so that no data (original or accumulated) would be lost.  The data could be exported from the database in XML, and then migrated from that to a desired platform.\n\nI have not been dealing with LSIDs as long as most on this list so I expect I'm glossing over (or missing) some of the concepts, so please let me know what I am lacking.  This is a needed service, and is a project I'd like to be involved in building.\n","updated":1414378977000,"excerpt":"","_id":"ohrcbkv6y6jgkrz1","photos":[],"link":""},{"author":"phil","comments":true,"date":1174673546000,"layout":"post","slug":"retirement-community-holds-a-wii-bowling-tournament","title":"Retirement community holds a Wii bowling tournament","wordpress_id":454,"categories":["huqfy1c4phxfv6ba"],"tags":["g2k347cxtkrb8jed","do5gdai4pwqauboo","vondpacnb5y0sjew"],"content":"<p><a href=\"http://www.erickson.com/ericksonvideogallery/evlPlayerver5.asp?videoname=sportsActivitiesStreaming&amp;var2=7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\"><img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/wii_sports_bowling_ss01.jpg\" alt=\"Wii Bowling\"></a>The blog <a href=\"http://blogs.usatoday.com/popcandy/2007/03/free_to_wii_you.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Popcandy</a> has a great article about  <a href=\"http://www.erickson.com/ericksonvideogallery/evlPlayerver5.asp?videoname=sportsActivitiesStreaming&amp;var2=7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">a retirement community is holding Wii Bowling tournaments</a>!

Pew finds that 18% of Americans believe President Obama is a Muslim. A new Newsweek poll, taken after the controversy over the New York mosque, places that figure at 24%. Even if he’s not a Muslim, Newsweek finds, 31 percent think it’s “definitely or probably” true that Obama “sympathizes with the goals of Islamic fundamentalists who want to impose Islamic law around the world.” When the focus is narrowed to Republicans, a Harris poll finds 57 percent of party members believe he is a Muslim, 22% believe he “wants the terrorists to win,” and 24% believe he is the Antichrist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These figures sadden me with the depth of thoughtlessness and credulity they imply. A democracy depends on an informed electorate to survive. An alarming number of Americans and a majority of Republicans are misinformed. The man who was swept into office by a decisive majority is now considered by many citizens to be the enemy. Some fundamentalists believe he is the Antichrist named by Jesus in the Bible.</p>\n<p>These opinions have an agenda. They seek to demonize the Obama Presidency and mainstream liberal politics in general. The conservatism they prefer is not the traditional conservatism of such figures as Taft, Nixon, Reagan, Buckley or Goldwater. It is a frightening new radical fringe movement, financed by such as the newly notorious billionaire Koch brothers, whose hatred of government extends even to opposition to tax funding for public schools.</p>\n<p>The money behind the movement has been shaken in its boots by the recent exposure of criminal activities in the money markets. Our economy has collapsed and it seemed clear to many Americans that the unregulated greed of Wall Street trading, especially in derivatives, was responsible. These were not investments in industry, the economy or the future. They were investments in a bold Ponzi scheme which defrauded home owners into fronting for a pyramid of worthless loans. Citizens lost their homes, investment houses went bankrupt, but the criminals responsible continued to pay themselves multi-million-dollar bonuses.</p>\n<p>From the same column by Krugman: “Wall Street has turned on Mr. Obama with a vengeance: last month Steve Schwarzman, the billionaire chairman of the Blackstone Group, the private equity giant, compared proposals to end tax loopholes for hedge fund managers with the Nazi invasion of Poland.”</p>\n<p>Say what? Proposals to end <em>loopholes?</em> Read that again. Our recession and the collapse of the housing and jobs markets squeezed through those loopholes. And if you agree with the Democratic attempts to close them, you are compared to Hitler? Republicans in Washington vote nearly as a block against financial reform. Shouldn’t the implications be clear to an informed electorate?</p>\n<p>This process may soon be arriving at a moment of truth. The new issue of Vanity Fair mentions in its profile of Sarah Palin, as a casual aside, that Glenn Beck has booked the Dena’ina Center, the largest venue in Anchorage, for the date of September 11, 2010. What do you think that means? It could mean Beck simply wants to hold a rally in the home state of the woman who shared his podium on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on the anniversary of Martin Luther King’s famous speech.</p>\n<p>Beck says he chose that date without realizing its significance. But it cannot be a coincidence that he has chosen 9/11. Nor does it take special insight to connect that date with Palin’s many statements about the “Ground Zero Mosque” and the even more pointed “9/11 Mosque.” The association is obvious: “9/11” feeds into “mosque” feeds into “Muslims” feeds into the misperception that Obama is a Muslim. Beck and Palin speak about “taking back America.” The buried message is that they will take it back from Muslims. This is a heartless misuse of the tragedy of 9/11 and its victims.</p>\n<p>If Beck had planned to come to Anchorage on another date, it wouldn’t have excited much notice. But any meeting in Alaska on 9/11 without Palin also present will be anticlimactic. It’s too far to go <em>not</em> to feature her. The symbolic date of 9/11 invests this event with the inescapable possibility that he and Palin plan to announce their Presidential candidacy for 2012.</p>\n<p>This is their privilege, and is not exactly unexpected. What is inescapable, given the timing, is that their candidacy would benefit from the paranoia already infecting so many Americans about Obama’s fictitious Islamic religion. Palin and Beck have so far both been content to let this process work without specific comment on their part. Their silence is a symptom of a cancer infecting American democracy. Our political immune system has only one antibody, and that is the truth.</p>\n<p>The time is here for responsible Americans to put up or shut up. I refer specifically to those who have credibility among the guileless and credulous citizens who have been infected with notions so carefully nurtured.

John McCain do not believe Obama is a Muslim. This is the time — now, not later — for them to repeat that belief in a joint statement. Other prominent Republicans such as Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul also certainly do not believe it. They have a responsibility to make that clear by subscribing to the statement. Glenn Beck, Sarah Palin and Rush Limbaugh must join, or let their silence indict them.

Look, while I expect this from news salesmen like them, when people that I know and  used to admire use religion to promote bigotry of others because they are of another religion, all bets are off. While you’ll hear other things on the news, our country was founded on the freedom of religion, which <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Wikipedia cites as</a>, “…<em>a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or community, in public or private, to manifest religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance; the concept is generally recognized also to include the freedom to change religion or not to follow any religion. The freedom to leave or discontinue membership in a religion or religious group —in religious terms called “apostasy” —is also a fundamental part of religious freedom.</em>“ When I spoke candidly with Europeans last week in London about this they shared my concern and bewilderment about the ever growing pollariztion of the religious camps on this issue, so it’s not just us that are confused. I really appreciate Matt from <a href=\"http://obtuseview.com/2010/09/01/and-the-calculating-and-inaccurate-shall-inheret-the-world/#comment-456\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Obtuse View</a> for reposting this today, and I think it’s something everyone should repost so at least a voice of reason can be heard over the din of commercial “news”.

Rarely are team-ups like this seen except in the pages of “Marvel Team-Ups” or “a very Special Episodes of Diff’rnt Strokes.”</em></p>\n<p>So the Pennsylvania school <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/02/19/laptop.suit/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">using webcams on district provided laptops to spy on its students</a> story just gets more and more bizarre.  The parents of one of kids is (rightfully) suing the school, <em>“…alleging the district unlawfully used its ability to access a webcam remotely on their son’s district-issued laptop computer […] _it watched him through his laptop’s webcam while he was at home and unaware he was being observed” _This is apparently proven when the school “caught” the student engaging in “improper behavior” in his home, via a webcam image.  Meanwhile the school claims it had the ability to observe images via the webcam, but that it would <strong>only be used if the laptop were reported to be lost stolen or missing</strong>, and even then “…the district would first have to _request access from its technology and security department and receive authorization.” _Additionally, the school claims this monitoring was all part of an agreement defining “acceptable-use” that the family had to sign to allow the student to take the laptop home, which also states that the family was required to buy insurance for the borrowed laptop.  So far, so ridiculous, but then it starts getting sillier…<a id=\"more\"></a></em></p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p>Now, as for the student’s﻿ “improper behavior” that the school claims they viewed is starting to come to light, thanks to the lawsuit.  While the school claims to have used the secret remote webcam activation ONLY 42 times (and only to ‘track down’ lost or stolen laptops) it hasn’t explained what this student was busted for, after all, he hadn’t stolen the computer.  Now it sounds like the school is claiming that,<em> <strong>“…the student was disciplined for was an <a href=\"http://techdirt.com/articles/20100221/2118128243.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">accusation of either drug use or drug selling</a>. For what? Well,<strong> the image showed the student with Mike &amp; Ikes candies</strong></strong>, which do have a passing resemblance to pills, but (last we checked) do not appear to be controlled substances.”</em> Now we all know that obesity is something we need to keep in check in this country, but a school counting how many jelly beans a kid is eating at home?  Come on!  But seriously, they thought the student was popping pills at home, and they thought this would be an acceptable use of their spying capability to bring this to light?  Just who are the geniuses behind this idea, much less the plan of using the webcams to track stolen laptops of students?  While using webcams to spy on users is pretty high tech, and seems to be a unbeatable to find the perps who lifted the laptops, I can’t think of any way (<em>cough</em> black tape) to stop the webcam (<em>cough</em> reinstall) from seeing the user, plus, once they have the perps image, they still have to figure out who that is, and pass it on up the chain.  While I’m all for schools protecting their property, I’ve always thought something less compicuous be used, like having software that <a href=\"http://www.securitykit.com/pc_phonehome.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">phones home</a> to alert authorities not only that the laptop has been stolen, but where it’s connecting from, and other specific details of the new user.  Of course there paid software <a href=\"http://www.orbicule.com/undercover/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Mac options out there</a>, free ones for <a href=\"http://preyproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Linux</a>, and even cooler ones for the DIY geek to really hack into (a <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/id/195408\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">keylogger being a particularly fun way to turn the tables and mess with the privacy of these perps</a>).  The point is, a cursory Google search reveals far more options without the obvious privacy of using a webcam to gather info.</p>\n<p>[caption id=”attachment_2134” align=”alignleft” width=”275” caption=”Yummy!”]<a href=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/mike_n_ikes.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\"><img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/mike_n_ikes.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a>[/caption]</p>\n<p>Now, with the court case still looming, the district is canceling the surveillance project, while blaming the snafu on two overzealous staffers.  The districts’ superintendent claims that, <em>“…mistakes might be made when combining technology and education in a cutting-edge way”</em>, but here’s hoping that’s just PR and not his real understanding of the issues at hand here.  While I think giving students their own laptops is a great idea, I can’t imagine anyone on a school board would thinking this would be the right way to protect their investment, especially when putting the insurance responsibility on the student’s families.  The outcome of this case can be followed on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_J._Robbins_v._Lower_Merion_School_District\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Wikipedia page covering the suit</a>, and fortunately cases like this serve to set new precidents for privacy, giving groups that promote such freedoms well deserved press to illistrate the good they do for all of us.  The <strong><a href=\"http://www.aclupa.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">ACLU of Pennsylvania</a></strong> isn’t involved in the lititgation, but, <em>“…its director, Vic Walczak, criticized the school district’s action. “Neither police nor school officials can enter a private home, physically or electronically, without an invitation or a warrant.

Enjoy.</p>\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This … is going to be a long one. And believe it or not, it’s a 100% true story. Its relation to World of Warcraft will not be immediately apparent. Anyway, the gist of what happened is <a href=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-admin/iPod%20prompts%20airport%20scare%20in%20Ottawa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">here</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It all started when I got out of my seat to go to the bathroom. I went to the bathroom, washed my hands, and returned to my seat. A little while later the two stewardesses on the flight crossed each other in the aisle. They had a quick conversation that I was in earshot of.</p>\n<p>“I locked off the front lav. There’s something in the toilet that’s preventing it from flushing. Run some water and see if you can clear it.” My face immediately turned red. The seat cover! I thought. It must have been too big to flush! I should have thrown it out!</p>\n<p>I was so embarrassed. I tried to act normal … I took a sudden interest in the contents of the seat pocket in front of me, acted nonchalant and all. I watched as the stewardess got on her hands and knees in the lavatory and did unfathomable dirty work.</p>\n<p>Sometime later, I decided it would be best if I forgot the whole thing happened, so I went to put on my headphones and drown myself in iPod music. But … no iPod. I panicked, checked my other pockets. Where was it? Not under the seat, not in the pockets, not … anywhere. I looked up to the stewardesses. One of them had run past me in a decent clip. She was carrying a green handbook. She brought it to the other stewardess. They flipped through the handbook, read a page, then made a call. The other stewardess had retrieved a blue metal box and was removing some equipment from it.</p>\n<p>I put two and two together. I knew what had happened.</p>\n<p>So I walked up to the stewardesses, both clamoring over the handbook, and tapped one on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>“So, I had an iPod before I went to the bathroom, and now I don’t. I think I know what’s in the toilet.”</p>\n<p>We had a quick conversation. I told them, “You don’t have to call the TSA or anything, it’s just my iPod.” They said, “Oh, but we already did.”</p>\n<p>So now I’m starting to realize that this is turning into a big problem. They offer their condolences, tell me that it’s unfortunate, and I take a seat. Okay. So far, not so bad. I return to my seat and spend the rest of the flight trying to act normal.</p>\n<p>That is, right up until the pilot comes over the intercom.</p>\n<p>“Folks, this is the captain. I don’t want to alarm you, but we’ve found a suspicious device in the front lavatory. Now, we think it’s probably nothing, but in this day and age … you can never be too careful. We’ll be landing at Ottawa, where we will await further instructions.”</p>\n<p>The cabin erupted with commotion. At that very moment, my face fell into my hands. What have I done?</p>\n<p>We landed at Ottawa, and we were taxiing to the gate. Without warning, the airplane then lurched to a sudden halt.</p>\n<p>“Folks, this is the captain. We’ve been ordered to make an immediate stop. Buses are coming to evacuate the aircraft.” We were to leave all of our belongings on the aircraft; we would be shuttled by bus to the terminal, where we would receive our carryon items.</p>\n<p>My face fell deeper into my hands. Next came the waiting. Waiting and listening to more worry and commotion. A lot of us wondered if we could bring cell phones, wallets, passports, or customs forms with us. The stewardesses didn’t have any answers; they had never been through this before.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, if I brought a cell phone, wallet, etc. etc., and they confiscated it, I would have to hunt and peck for it separately from my carryon luggage. But if I stuck all of that stuff in my carryon luggage, I would only have to find one bag when we clamored for our stuff in the future. I decided the smart thing to do was to stick everything in my carryon. But, I kept my wallet, because I knew I was in big trouble at this point.</p>\n<p>It took them 45 minutes to round up not just a bus and air-stairs, but an army of police and customs vehicles. One of the stewardesses took me aside and whispered to me. “Get off the plane last, and talk to the constable.”</p>\n<p>So I did. I exited the plane last, and spoke to the Ottawa police officer waiting at the air-stairs. I told him that the device was my iPod, and he took down my license number.</p>\n<p>I continued to the bus. After a brief wait, it did NOT take us to the terminal. It took us to some industrial facility, where they housed utility vehicles. There, in the open garage, we were instructed to sit and wait. And wait we did … another 30 minutes or so.</p>\n<p>This was possibly the worst part … While we were waiting I got to overhear the passengers talking about me. Well, they didn’t know it was me, but they knew someone had dropped an iPod in the toilet, and they made aaallll sorts of assumptions about this person.</p>\n<p>“Why didn’t he have it on a clip? He could have clipped it to his damn pants.” Or, “Why didn’t he tell the stewardesses? Why is he hiding it from them and making us go through this?”</p>\n<p>I could have corrected them. I could have told them that it WAS on a clip and I DID tell the stewardesses. In fact, it was a lot of self-restraint to just keep my mouth shut and not make things worse.</p>\n<p>By this time the sense of guilt had left me. This wasn’t my fault. Anyone could have dropped his stupid iPod in the toilet. It’s really the government here. I mean, at this point the building contained six customs officials, an army of policemen, people from various security agencies, a bomb squad, and a couple of detectives. No one was doing anything. No one was taking charge. <em>I</em> didn’t create this mess.</p>\n<p>The whole time, the officers were watching me. They had told me to keep in sight of them at all times.</p>\n<p>Finally, five or six customs officers set up a table and made an announcement. “We will be interviewing each of you one by one. Please form a line. Before we have our chat, make sure you have your ID, passport, and customs information with you.”</p>\n<p>One person asked, “What if that stuff is still on the plane?” The customs official responded, “Then we will have a more formal chat.”</p>\n<p>I got in line with the rest of the people, but shortly thereafter two police officers took me out of line. “Come with us.”</p>\n<p>They took me to a discreet corner. They brought out a tape recorder. I was told to put my hands up on the wall and spread my legs, and I was frisked from head to toe. They removed my wallet, disassembled it completely, and placed each of its contents in its own plastic evidence bag.</p>\n<p>“Now Tim, for the sake of the tape recorder, I want you to state your full name and address.” I did. “Now, each of us will state our name and position into the tape recorder.” There were two detectives from the police department, a detective from Customs, and two members of the bomb squad.</p>\n<p>Then started the questions. They were easy at first. They asked me where I lived. What do I do for a living? Why am I unemployed? How come it’s taken me 4 months to find a job?</p>\n<p>They asked me why I was visiting Canada. I was to visit a friend I met on World of Warcraft, Cara. They took down her name and what I could remember of her address. They asked me how we met.</p>\n<p>“In an online game.”<br>“What online game?”<br>“Umm … World of Warcraft,” I responded meekly.<br>“What kind of game is this?”<br>“It’s a fantasy game … it takes place online.”<br>“Fantasy … like it’s got wizards and warlocks?”<br>“Well, it’s got warlocks.” (And they need to be nerfed.)</p>\n<p>They asked me to describe my relation to Cara. I told them that people meet up in the game and go on adventures together, and that Cara and I were in a guild together that I was the leader of. They confused the concept of a guild with the game, however, and I had them believing that I was the Lord and Leader of all of WoW until I was able to correct them, and explain to them what a guild was.</p>\n<p>So, when they put the pieces together; namely, that I was visiting a female person that I had met over a computer game, their next line of questioning went down an obvious path.</p>\n<p>“So you and Cara are friends?”<br>“Yes.”<br>“How long have you known her?”<br>“About 5 months I think?  Maybe less.”<br>“Do you have a romantic relationship with Cara?”<br>“No.”<br>“Do you want a romantic relationship with Cara?”<br>“No.”<br>“OK, so … if you and Cara were drunk together, and she turned to you and said, ‘Tim, let’s go—‘“</p>\n<p>I interrupted him. “Excuse me … what’s the point of these questions?” The detective hardened. “Let me make things clear. I ask questions. You answer them. Do we have an understanding?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.” I paused. “I just don’t see how this is relevant.”</p>\n<p>He spoke right in my face. “I’ve got 5 good men going into that airplane right now. Five of my best bomb squad guys. If there is any reason that I should be concerned for their life, then I need to know now. So just answer the questions, and do as I say.”</p>\n<p>Now the questions became really pointed. What do you think about 9/11? What are your views on the Iran issue? Do you think government is too big, too powerful? Would you ever “make a point?”</p>\n<p>He asked me if I knew how to make a bomb. “I have a degree in physics, and I’m not an idiot.” Of course I knew how to make a bomb — what kind of question is that?? The better question is, WOULD I make a bomb? The answer is no.</p>\n<p>They tried to trap me with some of their questions. I noticed they would try to get me to contradict myself. Like, I had earlier mentioned that I had never met Cara in real life, so they would later nonchalantly ask me when I had last seen Cara. Stuff like that.</p>\n<p>He told me there was a similar bomb scare in LA today. He asked me if I was connected with it. He asked me if I was connected to the “liquid” thing from Britain.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Finally, he was done. He and the two bomb squad guys left. The customs lady followed up with more prying personal questions. She asked me more about Cara, how I got to know her, how we interact, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The interviewers would periodically withdraw to talk about me in French, then return with followup questions. I was picked apart by these questions. They wanted to know how I could pay for my ticket, being unemployed, and what my motivations for visiting Cara were. They had me on the defensive the whole time.</p>\n<p>She had finished her interview and I was then returned to the garage where they were questioning everyone else on the plane, one by one. I waited for another hour or so as the bomb squad did their thing (I assume). Eventually, they loaded everyone up on the bus to take them to retrieve their stuff. Except me — I and two others were to be inspected by Customs.</p>\n<p>They took my photo, asked me to wait in the cold for 30 minutes, and then escorted me to a red van. Along the way I passed the detective who had first interviewed me. He was carrying a green paper bag. He called me over.</p>\n<p>“I just got it back from the bomb squad. It’s an iPod. Do you want it back?”<br>“It’s been in the toilet.”<br>“Yeah, it’s messy.” Then he walked right up to my ear. “Tim, you’re not in any trouble anymore. Nothing you say now is going to be on record. I want you to answer a question honestly, just for me, not for my agency.”<br>“OK?”<br>He whispered into my ear. “Did you … did you take a dump, and then drop your iPod in the toilet on accident?”</p>\n<p>“No!” I yelled a little too loudly. “Like I said … I didn’t notice it was missing until after!”</p>\n<p>“OK, OK.  I believe you. You did great, Tim.”</p>\n<p>I got my wallet back and was escorted by police to the van. I waited some more on this van, and finally it took me to a harmless immigration office. I waited some more there, the whole time being watched and followed by police officers. Finally, they escorted me to the baggage claim to fetch my stuff, and took me to a very private room with some bomb-screening equipment and tinted mirrors for windows.</p>\n<p>It was me and a gruff, humorless customs official. He unpacked my luggage entirely, ran the contents of my wallet through a bomb sweep, and carefully examined all of my belongings. He then asked me to turn on my laptop. I did, and he began using it. I saw him open Spotlight and begin searching.</p>\n<p>“Do you connect to the Internet on this laptop?”<br>“Yes.”<br>“Have you downloaded and images?”<br>“Huh? What do you mean?”<br>“Do you have any pornography?”<br>“No.”</p>\n<p>I waited in total silence for about 10 minutes as he kept searching and searching, until I finally asked him, “What are you looking for?”</p>\n<p>“Contraband,” he said without looking up at me.<br>“Such as?”<br>“Child pornography, hate propaganda.”<br>“Child porn I can understand, that’s illegal. But hate propaganda is protected speech.”<br>Now he looked up. “What country do you think you’re in?”<br>“Oh, it’s illegal in Canada?”<br>“I honestly don’t know. But that doesn’t matter. I get to decide what goes in this country. Do you have a problem with that?”<br>I paused for a long time while I thought about what I should say to this. “Yes.”<br>“Yes, you do have a problem?”<br>“Yes, I do. If it’s illegal in Canada I’ll understand, but saying ‘I don’t want it in my country’ isn’t good enough when you’re a government official.”</p>\n<p>Now he was pissed. “Don’t fool around with me. I’m sure you want this to end as much as I do. So I will ask you questions, and you will answer. Do you understand?”</p>\n<p>Another long pause while I thought. “Yes, I do.”</p>\n<p>He continued his exhaustive audit of my computer’s contents, then returned it to me. We waited for a Customs escort, who showed me out of the room and back to the terminal. There they left me without saying a word, and I was free to go.</p>\n<p>I found Cara and Andy, and my vacation in Canada began.</p>\n<p>(The first three people that post “TLDR” get negative haikus written about their character names.)</p>\n","source":"_posts/somebody-set-up-us-the-bomb.markdown","raw":"---\nauthor: phil\ncomments: true\ndate: 2007-03-02 13:47:33\nlayout: post\nslug: somebody-set-up-us-the-bomb\ntitle: Somebody set up us the bomb\nwordpress_id: 445\ncategories:\n- General\ntags:\n- security\n---\n\n![Bomb](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/bomb.gif)In this day and age security is often OVER emphasised in the guise of erroring on the side of caution (cue to pictures of shoeless passengers muddling through security checkpoints).

Anyway, the gist of what happened is [here](http://fak3r.com/wp-admin/iPod%20prompts%20airport%20scare%20in%20Ottawa).\n\nIt all started when I got out of my seat to go to the bathroom. I went to the bathroom, washed my hands, and returned to my seat. A little while later the two stewardesses on the flight crossed each other in the aisle. They had a quick conversation that I was in earshot of.\n\n\"I locked off the front lav. There's something in the toilet that's preventing it from flushing. Run some water and see if you can clear it.\" My face immediately turned red. The seat cover! I thought. It must have been too big to flush! I should have thrown it out!\n\nI was so embarrassed. I tried to act normal ... I took a sudden interest in the contents of the seat pocket in front of me, acted nonchalant and all. I watched as the stewardess got on her hands and knees in the lavatory and did unfathomable dirty work.\n\nSometime later, I decided it would be best if I forgot the whole thing happened, so I went to put on my headphones and drown myself in iPod music. But ... no iPod. I panicked, checked my other pockets. Where was it? Not under the seat, not in the pockets, not ... anywhere. I looked up to the stewardesses. One of them had run past me in a decent clip. She was carrying a green handbook. She brought it to the other stewardess. They flipped through the handbook, read a page, then made a call. The other stewardess had retrieved a blue metal box and was removing some equipment from it.\n\nI put two and two together. I knew what had happened.\n\nSo I walked up to the stewardesses, both clamoring over the handbook, and tapped one on the shoulder.\n\n\"So, I had an iPod before I went to the bathroom, and now I don't. I think I know what's in the toilet.\"\n\nWe had a quick conversation. I told them, \"You don't have to call the TSA or anything, it's just my iPod.\" They said, \"Oh, but we already did.\"\n\nSo now I'm starting to realize that this is turning into a big problem. They offer their condolences, tell me that it's unfortunate, and I take a seat. Okay. So far, not so bad. I return to my seat and spend the rest of the flight trying to act normal.\n\nThat is, right up until the pilot comes over the intercom.\n\n\"Folks, this is the captain. I don't want to alarm you, but we've found a suspicious device in the front lavatory. Now, we think it's probably nothing, but in this day and age ... you can never be too careful. We'll be landing at Ottawa, where we will await further instructions.\"\n\nThe cabin erupted with commotion. At that very moment, my face fell into my hands. What have I done?\n\nWe landed at Ottawa, and we were taxiing to the gate. Without warning, the airplane then lurched to a sudden halt.\n\n\"Folks, this is the captain. We've been ordered to make an immediate stop. Buses are coming to evacuate the aircraft.\" We were to leave all of our belongings on the aircraft; we would be shuttled by bus to the terminal, where we would receive our carryon items.\n\nMy face fell deeper into my hands. Next came the waiting. Waiting and listening to more worry and commotion. A lot of us wondered if we could bring cell phones, wallets, passports, or customs forms with us. The stewardesses didn't have any answers; they had never been through this before.\n\nOn the one hand, if I brought a cell phone, wallet, etc. etc., and they confiscated it, I would have to hunt and peck for it separately from my carryon luggage. But if I stuck all of that stuff in my carryon luggage, I would only have to find one bag when we clamored for our stuff in the future. I decided the smart thing to do was to stick everything in my carryon. But, I kept my wallet, because I knew I was in big trouble at this point.\n\nIt took them 45 minutes to round up not just a bus and air-stairs, but an army of police and customs vehicles. One of the stewardesses took me aside and whispered to me. \"Get off the plane last, and talk to the constable.\"\n\nSo I did. I exited the plane last, and spoke to the Ottawa police officer waiting at the air-stairs. I told him that the device was my iPod, and he took down my license number.\n\nI continued to the bus. After a brief wait, it did NOT take us to the terminal. It took us to some industrial facility, where they housed utility vehicles. There, in the open garage, we were instructed to sit and wait. And wait we did ... another 30 minutes or so.\n\nThis was possibly the worst part ... While we were waiting I got to overhear the passengers talking about me. Well, they didn't know it was me, but they knew someone had dropped an iPod in the toilet, and they made aaallll sorts of assumptions about this person.\n\n\"Why didn't he have it on a clip? He could have clipped it to his damn pants.\" Or, \"Why didn't he tell the stewardesses? Why is he hiding it from them and making us go through this?\"\n\nI could have corrected them. I could have told them that it WAS on a clip and I DID tell the stewardesses. In fact, it was a lot of self-restraint to just keep my mouth shut and not make things worse.\n\nBy this time the sense of guilt had left me. This wasn't my fault. Anyone could have dropped his stupid iPod in the toilet. It's really the government here. I mean, at this point the building contained six customs officials, an army of policemen, people from various security agencies, a bomb squad, and a couple of detectives. No one was doing anything. No one was taking charge. *I* didn't create this mess.\n\nThe whole time, the officers were watching me. They had told me to keep in sight of them at all times.\n\nFinally, five or six customs officers set up a table and made an announcement. \"We will be interviewing each of you one by one. Please form a line. Before we have our chat, make sure you have your ID, passport, and customs information with you.\"\n\nOne person asked, \"What if that stuff is still on the plane?\" The customs official responded, \"Then we will have a more formal chat.\"\n\nI got in line with the rest of the people, but shortly thereafter two police officers took me out of line. \"Come with us.\"\n\nThey took me to a discreet corner. They brought out a tape recorder. I was told to put my hands up on the wall and spread my legs, and I was frisked from head to toe. They removed my wallet, disassembled it completely, and placed each of its contents in its own plastic evidence bag.\n\n\"Now Tim, for the sake of the tape recorder, I want you to state your full name and address.\" I did. \"Now, each of us will state our name and position into the tape recorder.\" There were two detectives from the police department, a detective from Customs, and two members of the bomb squad.\n\nThen started the questions. They were easy at first. They asked me where I lived. What do I do for a living? Why am I unemployed? How come it's taken me 4 months to find a job?\n\nThey asked me why I was visiting Canada. I was to visit a friend I met on World of Warcraft, Cara. They took down her name and what I could remember of her address. They asked me how we met.\n\n\"In an online game.\"\n\"What online game?\"\n\"Umm ... World of Warcraft,\" I responded meekly.\n\"What kind of game is this?\"\n\"It's a fantasy game ... it takes place online.\"\n\"Fantasy ... like it's got wizards and warlocks?\"\n\"Well, it's got warlocks.\" (And they need to be nerfed.)\n\nThey asked me to describe my relation to Cara. I told them that people meet up in the game and go on adventures together, and that Cara and I were in a guild together that I was the leader of. They confused the concept of a guild with the game, however, and I had them believing that I was the Lord and Leader of all of WoW until I was able to correct them, and explain to them what a guild was.\n\nSo, when they put the pieces together; namely, that I was visiting a female person that I had met over a computer game, their next line of questioning went down an obvious path.\n\n\"So you and Cara are friends?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"How long have you known her?\"\n\"About 5 months I think?  Maybe less.\"\n\"Do you have a romantic relationship with Cara?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Do you want a romantic relationship with Cara?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"OK, so ... if you and Cara were drunk together, and she turned to you and said, 'Tim, let's go--'\"\n\nI interrupted him. \"Excuse me ... what's the point of these questions?\" The detective hardened. \"Let me make things clear. I ask questions. You answer them. Do we have an understanding?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" I paused. \"I just don't see how this is relevant.\"\n\nHe spoke right in my face. \"I've got 5 good men going into that airplane right now. Five of my best bomb squad guys. If there is any reason that I should be concerned for their life, then I need to know now. So just answer the questions, and do as I say.\"\n\nNow the questions became really pointed. What do you think about 9/11? What are your views on the Iran issue? Do you think government is too big, too powerful? Would you ever \"make a point?\"\n\nHe asked me if I knew how to make a bomb. \"I have a degree in physics, and I'm not an idiot.\" Of course I knew how to make a bomb -- what kind of question is that?? The better question is, WOULD I make a bomb? The answer is no.\n\nThey tried to trap me with some of their questions. I noticed they would try to get me to contradict myself. Like, I had earlier mentioned that I had never met Cara in real life, so they would later nonchalantly ask me when I had last seen Cara. Stuff like that.\n\nHe told me there was a similar bomb scare in LA today. He asked me if I was connected with it. He asked me if I was connected to the \"liquid\" thing from Britain.\n\n\n\n\n> Finally, he was done. He and the two bomb squad guys left. The customs lady followed up with more prying personal questions. She asked me more about Cara, how I got to know her, how we interact, etc.\n\nThe interviewers would periodically withdraw to talk about me in French, then return with followup questions. I was picked apart by these questions. They wanted to know how I could pay for my ticket, being unemployed, and what my motivations for visiting Cara were. They had me on the defensive the whole time.\n\nShe had finished her interview and I was then returned to the garage where they were questioning everyone else on the plane, one by one. I waited for another hour or so as the bomb squad did their thing (I assume). Eventually, they loaded everyone up on the bus to take them to retrieve their stuff. Except me -- I and two others were to be inspected by Customs.\n\nThey took my photo, asked me to wait in the cold for 30 minutes, and then escorted me to a red van. Along the way I passed the detective who had first interviewed me. He was carrying a green paper bag. He called me over.\n\n\"I just got it back from the bomb squad. It's an iPod. Do you want it back?\"\n\"It's been in the toilet.\"\n\"Yeah, it's messy.\" Then he walked right up to my ear. \"Tim, you're not in any trouble anymore. Nothing you say now is going to be on record. I want you to answer a question honestly, just for me, not for my agency.\"\n\"OK?\"\nHe whispered into my ear. \"Did you ... did you take a dump, and then drop your iPod in the toilet on accident?\"\n\n\"No!\" I yelled a little too loudly. \"Like I said ... I didn't notice it was missing until after!\"\n\n\"OK, OK.  I believe you. You did great, Tim.\"\n\nI got my wallet back and was escorted by police to the van. I waited some more on this van, and finally it took me to a harmless immigration office. I waited some more there, the whole time being watched and followed by police officers. Finally, they escorted me to the baggage claim to fetch my stuff, and took me to a very private room with some bomb-screening equipment and tinted mirrors for windows.\n\nIt was me and a gruff, humorless customs official. He unpacked my luggage entirely, ran the contents of my wallet through a bomb sweep, and carefully examined all of my belongings. He then asked me to turn on my laptop. I did, and he began using it. I saw him open Spotlight and begin searching.\n\n\"Do you connect to the Internet on this laptop?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Have you downloaded and images?\"\n\"Huh? What do you mean?\"\n\"Do you have any pornography?\"\n\"No.\"\n\nI waited in total silence for about 10 minutes as he kept searching and searching, until I finally asked him, \"What are you looking for?\"\n\n\"Contraband,\" he said without looking up at me.\n\"Such as?\"\n\"Child pornography, hate propaganda.\"\n\"Child porn I can understand, that's illegal. But hate propaganda is protected speech.\"\nNow he looked up. \"What country do you think you're in?\"\n\"Oh, it's illegal in Canada?\"\n\"I honestly don't know. But that doesn't matter. I get to decide what goes in this country. Do you have a problem with that?\"\nI paused for a long time while I thought about what I should say to this. \"Yes.\"\n\"Yes, you do have a problem?\"\n\"Yes, I do. If it's illegal in Canada I'll understand, but saying 'I don't want it in my country' isn't good enough when you're a government official.\"\n\nNow he was pissed. \"Don't fool around with me. I'm sure you want this to end as much as I do. So I will ask you questions, and you will answer. Do you understand?\"\n\nAnother long pause while I thought. \"Yes, I do.\"\n\nHe continued his exhaustive audit of my computer's contents, then returned it to me. We waited for a Customs escort, who showed me out of the room and back to the terminal. There they left me without saying a word, and I was free to go.\n\nI found Cara and Andy, and my vacation in Canada began.\n\n(The first three people that post \"TLDR\" get negative haikus written about their character names.)\n","updated":1414378977000,"excerpt":"<p><img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/bomb.gif\" alt=\"Bomb\">In this day and age security is often OVER emphasised in the guise of erroring on the side of caution (cue to pictures of shoeless passengers muddling through security checkpoints).

Organized here <a href=\"http://bit.ly/8LGUCr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://bit.ly/8LGUCr</a> - one of the main things we wanted to cover, is to review what data is available now (or should be) out on Amazon’s free public data sets: <a href=\"http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/kbcategory.jspa?categoryID=243\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/kbcategory.jspa?categoryID=243</a> From there we derived a software stack from ideas of what would be useful for biodiversity folks to have on an EC2 compatible Debian Linux instance to do distributed computing against those sets. <a href=\"http://bit.ly/8GSEa7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://bit.ly/8GSEa7</a> This in turn builds off of what has already been done with BioLinux <a href=\"http://www.jcvi.org/cms/research/projects/jcvi-cloud-biolinux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://www.jcvi.org/cms/research/projects/jcvi-cloud-biolinux/</a> which is more of a desktop-able EC2/Eucalyptus image.

That’s mine on the right, yeah, she got around a bit, but hey.  So anyway, here’s a great site with an overview of the evolution of the <a href=\"http://blog.hahauk.com/2007/01/evolution-of-controller.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">video game controller</a>, all the way back to the Magnavox Odyssey.  Wow, I’ve owned 8 of those systems!  Atari 2600, Colecovision, NES, Sega Genesis, SNES, Sony Playstation, Gamecube and now the Wii.  Yeah, the only Nintendo I didn’t own was the N64, which supposedly rocked.  Then if you really want to get into it, there’s a fantastic ‘family tree’ version with even more (all?) of the controllers; <a href=\"http://www.axess.com/twilight/console/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Sock Master’s Game Console Controller Family Tree</a>!  Much more in depth, with details once you click on them.  Far out, fun to see how Nintendo lead so much of the way, but also to see how the Xbox followed Saturn’s lead.

That's mine on the right, yeah, she got around a bit, but hey.  So anyway, here's a great site with an overview of the evolution of the [video game controller](http://blog.hahauk.com/2007/01/evolution-of-controller.html), all the way back to the Magnavox Odyssey.  Wow, I've owned 8 of those systems!  Atari 2600, Colecovision, NES, Sega Genesis, SNES, Sony Playstation, Gamecube and now the Wii.  Yeah, the only Nintendo I didn't own was the N64, which supposedly rocked.  Then if you really want to get into it, there's a fantastic 'family tree' version with even more (all?) of the controllers; [Sock Master's Game Console Controller Family Tree](http://www.axess.com/twilight/console/)!  Much more in depth, with details once you click on them.  Far out, fun to see how Nintendo lead so much of the way, but also to see how the Xbox followed Saturn's lead.  Damn, and I played the Atari Jaguar at a party (\"avoid the ground!\") and that controller bit, hard.  But check out 'The Nintendo Game & Watch', a Donkey Kong game from 1982; the case is a dead ringer for the Nintendo DS!

First of all the results, Hillary took 39% of the popular vote to Barack ‘s 37%, so Hillary wins, right?  Not exactly, if you look at the delegate count you’ll see a different picture.  Remember, people can win the popular vote and loose the election (Gore).  From the article/discussion on <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/01/09/final-the-new-hampshire-delegate-breakdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">CNN’s Political Ticker</a> you’ll see the results:<a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the New Hampshire Democratic primary</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>CNN estimates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Hillary Clinton has <strong>won 9 New Hampshire delegates (3 statewide, 6 district-level)</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Barack Obama has won <strong>9 New Hampshire delegates (3 statewide, 6 district-level)</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>John Edwards has won 4 New Hampshire delegates (2 statewide, 2 district-level)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>22 Democratic delegates were at stake in the New Hampshire primary</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ok, so it was a tie in regards to the delegates, but Hillary won the popular vote, but wait, what about the ‘superdelegates’ in New Hampshire?  Back to the article:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>There are also <strong>8 Democratic “superdelegates” in New Hampshire. Of those, 2 support Clinton and 3 support Obama</strong>, according to a CNN survey.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So now it looks like Obama was actually the winner, making the ‘win’ for Hillary seems like an old fashioned PR/spinfest.

Even worse, by the end of the day nearly 50 variants of the exploit had already appeared. One security company said the possibilities were endless on how the flaw could be exploited. ‘This vulnerability can be used to install any type of malicious code, not just Trojans and spyware, but also worms, bots or viruses that can cause irreparable damage to computers,’ said Luis Corrons of Panda Software. […] Attempting to allay fears, Microsoft said there would be no way for an attacker to force a user to visit a malicious Web site. However, Sunbelt vice president of Research and Development Eric Sites said there were ways to easily get around that issue. “For example, take the latest craze of posting spam in blog talkbacks,” Sites said. “How would you like to be reading your favorite blog, click the talkback link and get infected so badly your only option is to reinstall your operating system</em>.”  A zero-day exploit is one that takes advantage of a security vulnerability on the same day that the vulnerability becomes generally known; so it’s out there, and there is no fix for it.  It just shows the lack of security when ONE OS is so dominant.

Even worse, by the end of the day nearly 50 variants of the exploit had already appeared. One security company said the possibilities were endless on how the flaw could be exploited. ‘This vulnerability can be used to install any type of malicious code, not just Trojans and spyware, but also worms, bots or viruses that can cause irreparable damage to computers,’ said Luis Corrons of Panda Software. […] Attempting to allay fears, Microsoft said there would be no way for an attacker to force a user to visit a malicious Web site. However, Sunbelt vice president of Research and Development Eric Sites said there were ways to easily get around that issue. “For example, take the latest craze of posting spam in blog talkbacks,” Sites said. “How would you like to be reading your favorite blog, click the talkback link and get infected so badly your only option is to reinstall your operating system_.”  A zero-day exploit is one that takes advantage of a security vulnerability on the same day that the vulnerability becomes generally known; so it’s out there, and there is no fix for it.  It just shows the lack of security when ONE OS is so dominant.

Plua, the work is great, I get to play in Linux, setup new enviroments, and have a say in how *I* think things should work; none of this \"This is the way we've always done it\" BS.  So here I am, at a big company, where I have to wear a tie (see title for bad pun) everyday, but loving the fact that it doesn't feel like a big company, that I get to play all day in Linux getting apps running and there's virtually no stress (and no on-call, and no 40+ hour work weeks...).  Oh, and I clean up nice, thanks to a new load of shirts and ties my wife picked out, so the whole \"I never want to have to wear a tie to work\" is proving not to be *as* bad as I've always feared.  Yeah, life is good.\n","updated":1414378977000,"excerpt":"<p>[caption id=”” align=”alignright” width=”237” caption=”Tie goes to the runner, tie one on, fit to be tied, what other bad puns can I think up?”]<img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/manpolkatie.jpg\" alt=\"tie\">[/caption]</p>\n<p>I’ve had a ton of jobs, some would say this is a liability, but if questioned I have perfectly good reasons why I stayed at x company 3 years, and y company 5 months. For backup my references have no problem singing my praises and sighting my work ethic and humor as positive components that I bring to the scene.   My feeling about work is defined by a saying a former co-worker once shared with me, it’s simple: <strong>“What’s the worst they can do, fire you?</strong>“  Think about it, it’s only a job, you owe it to yourself to do good work, but if it’s not making you happy it’s time to start looking. If you’re ever been fired or laid off like me, you may have a better perspective on this; it happens, it’s no big, people move on. This is reason why I (and you) have to keep networking with other worker (droids) and recruiters/consultants EVEN WHEN YOU’RE NOT LOOKING.</p>\n","_id":"tjitbnj3ito0iv6t","tags":[],"photos":[],"link":""},{"author":"phil","comments":true,"date":1175524987000,"layout":"post","slug":"tjx-breach-total-over-457-million-card-numbers-stolen","title":"TJX breach total: over 45.7 million card numbers stolen","wordpress_id":477,"categories":["wlloztflg4khximt","isgo3ssu5wh0nheg"],"tags":["lr4ic1r58xtqqh63","m2o4ftcpev3apfw1"],"content":"<p><img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/pawnedjpegsmall.jpg\" alt=\"powned.\">I reported on this <a href=\"http://fak3r.com/2007/01/19/tjx-companies-data-breach-reveals-credit-card-data/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">earlier</a>, but only now are we learning the <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2007/03/tjx_breach_invo.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">scope of the breach</a>.  “<em>At least <strong>45.7 million credit and debit card numbers were stolen</strong> by <strong>hackers who broke into the computer systems at the <a href=\"http://boston.stockgroup.com/sn_overview.asp?ticker=TJX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">TJX Cos.</a> in Framingham and the United Kingdom and siphoned off data over a period of several years, making it the <strong>biggest breach of personal data ever reported</strong>, according to security specialists.

Only four are true.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>August 28, 2009</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong> **</strong>Summary**</p>\n<p>Our inbox has been overrun with messages asking us to weigh in on a mammoth list of claims about the House health care bill. The chain e-mail purports to give “a few highlights” from the first half of the bill, but the list of 48 assertions is filled with falsehoods, exaggerations and misinterpretations. We examined each of the e-mail’s claims, finding 26 of them to be false and 18 to be misleading, only partly true or half true. Only four are accurate. A few of our “highlights”:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The e-mail claims that page 30 of the bill says that “a government committee will decide what treatments … you get,” but that page refers to a “private-public advisory committee” that would “recommend” what minimum benefits would be included in basic, enhanced and premium insurance plans.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The e-mail says that “non-US citizens, illegal or not, will be provided with free healthcare services” but points to a provision that prohibits discrimination in health care based on “personal characteristics.” Another provision explicity forbids “federal payment for undocumented aliens.”</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>It says “[g]overnment will restrict enrollment of SPECIAL NEEDS individuals.” This provision isn’t about children with learning disabilities; instead, it pertains to restricted enrollment in “special needs” plans, a category of Medicare Advantage plans. Enrollment is already restricted. The bill extends the ability to do that.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>It claims that a section about “Community-based Home Medical Services” means “more payoffs for ACORN.” ACORN does not provide medical home services. The e-mail interprets any reference to the word “community” to be some kind of payoff for ACORN. That’s nonsense.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Analysis\"><strong>Analysis</strong></h2>\n<p>This chain e-mail claims to give a run-down of what’s in the House health care bill, <a href=\"http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h3200ih.txt.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">H.R. 3200</a>.

Curtis Blackwood, published a version of the e-mail in a newsletter to constituents, telling them that while going through e-mail, he came across “some interesting information on the Democrats’ big health care bill, H.R. 3200. … While this is federal legislation and not state, the topic is of enough significance that I thought many of you would be interested in reading it.” We’d refer Rep. Blackwood to our special report on viral messages titled, “<a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2008/03/that-chain-e-mail-your-friend-sent-to-you-is-likely-bogus-seriously/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">That Chain E-mail Your Friend Sent to You Is (Likely) Bogus. Seriously</a>.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We can trace the origins of this collection of claims to <a href=\"http://blog.flecksoflife.com/2009/07/19/the-hc-monstrosity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">a conservative blogger</a> who issued his instant and mostly mistaken analyses as brief “tweets” sent via Twitter as he was paging through the 1,017-page bill. The claims have been embraced as true and posted on hundreds of Web sites, and forwarded in the form of chain e-mails countless times. But there’s hardly any truth in them. We’ll go through each of the claims in this message:</p>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 22: Mandates audits of all employers that self-insure!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>False: </strong>This section merely requires a study of “the large group insured and self-insured employer health care markets.” There’s no mention of auditing employers, only of studying “markets.” The purpose of the study is to produce “recommendations” to make sure the new law “does not provide incentives for small and mid-size employers to self-insure.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 29: Admission: your health care will be rationed!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>False: </strong>This section says nothing whatsoever about “rationing” or anything of the sort. Actually, it’s favorable to families and individuals, placing an annual cap on what they could pay out of pocket if covered by a basic, “essential benefits package.” The limits would be $5,000 for an individual, $10,000 for a family.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 30: A government committee will decide what treatments and benefits you get (and, unlike an insurer, there will be no appeals process)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>False: </strong>Actually, the section starting on page 30 sets up a “private-public advisory committee” headed by the U.S. surgeon general and made up of mostly private sector “medical and other experts” selected by the president and the comptroller general. The advisory committee would have only the power “to recommend” what benefits are included in basic, enhanced and premium insurance plans. It would have no power to decide what treatments anybody will get. Its recommendations on benefits might or might not be adopted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 42: The “Health Choices Commissioner” will decide health benefits for you. You will have no choice. None.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>False: </strong>The new Health Choices Commissioner will oversee a variety of choices to be offered through new insurance exchanges. The bill itself specifies the “minimum services to be covered” in a basic plan, including prescription drugs, mental health services, maternity and well-baby care and certain vaccines and preventive services (pages 27-28). We find nothing in the bill that prevents insurance companies from offering benefits that exceed the minimums. In fact, the legislation allows (page 84) any company that offers an approved basic plan to offer also an “enhanced” plan, a “premium” plan and even a “premium plus” plan that could include vision and dental benefits.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 50: All non-US citizens, illegal or not, will be provided with free healthcare services.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>False.</strong> That’s simply not what the bill says at all. This page includes “SEC. 152. PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION IN HEALTH CARE,” which says that “[e]xcept as otherwise explicitly permitted by this Act and by subsequent regulations consistent with this Act, all health care and related services (including insurance coverage and public health activities) covered by this Act shall be provided without regard to personal characteristics extraneous to the provision of high quality health care or related services.” However, the bill does explicitly say that illegal immigrants can’t get any government money to pay for health care. Page 143 states: “Nothing in this subtitle shall allow Federal payments for affordability credits on behalf of individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States.” And as <a href=\"http://factcheck.org/2009/07/misleading-gop-health-care-claims/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">we’ve said before</a>, current law prohibits illegal immigrants from participating in government health care programs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 58: Every person will be issued a National ID Healthcard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>False. </strong>There is no mention of any “National ID Healthcard” anywhere in the bill. Page 58 says that government standards for electronic medical transactions “may include utilization of a machine-readable health plan beneficiary identification card,” to show eligibility for services. Insurance companies typically issue such cards already, but if such a standard were issued the cards would need to be in a standard form readable by computers. The word “may” is used to permit such a standard, but it does not require one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 59: The federal government will have direct, real-time access to all individual bank accounts for electronic funds transfer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>False. </strong>This section aims to simplify electronic payments for health services, the same sort of electronic payments that already are common for such things as utility bills or mortgage payments. The bill calls for the secretary of Health and Human Services to set standards for electronic administrative transactions that would “enable electronic funds transfers, in order to allow automated reconciliation with the related health care payment and remittance advice.” There is no mention of “individual bank accounts” nor of any new government authority over them. Also, the section does not say that electronic payments from consumers is required.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 65: Taxpayers will subsidize all union retiree and community organizer health plans (read: SEIU, UAW and ACORN)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Misleading.</strong> Page 65 is the start of a section (SEC. 164. REINSURANCE PROGRAM FOR RETIREES) that would set up a new federal reinsurance plan to benefit retirees and spouses covered by _any _employer plan, not just those run by labor unions or nonprofit groups. Specifically, it covers “retirees and . . . spouses, surviving spouses and dependents of such retirees” who are covered by “employment-based plans” that provide health benefits. It’s open to any “group health benefits plan that . . . is maintained by one or more employers, former employers or employee associations,” as well as voluntary employees’ beneficiary associations (page 66). Furthermore, the aim of the fund is to cut premiums, copays and deductibles for the retirees. Payment “shall not be used to reduce the costs of an employer.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 72: All private healthcare plans must conform to government rules to participate in a Healthcare Exchange.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>True.</strong> This page begins a section setting up a new, national Health Insurance Exchange through which individuals and employers may choose from a variety of private insurance plans, much like the system that now covers millions of federal workers. Any private insurance plans offered through this exchange must meet new federal standards. For example, such plans can’t deny coverage for preexisting medical conditions (page 19).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 84: All private healthcare plans must participate in the Health care Exchange (i.e., total government control of private plans)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Partly true.</strong> Nothing like this appears on page 84. No insurance company is required to sell plans through the exchange if it doesn’t want to. Any employer may choose to buy coverage elsewhere. In fact, the vast majority of employers will still be buying private plans through the normal marketplace, because only employers with 10 or fewer employees are even allowed to buy through the exchange in the first year. The limit rises to 20 employees in the second year. However, new plans sold directly to individuals will only be sold through the exchange. Individuals who currently buy their own coverage can keep those plans if they wish, and if the insurance company continues to offer them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 91: Government mandates linguistic infrastructure for services; translation: illegal aliens</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Misleading.</strong> It’s true that page 91 says that insurance companies selling plans through the new exchange “shall provide for culturally and linguistically appropriate communication and health services.” The author’s “translation,” however, assumes that anyone speaking a foreign language or from another culture is an <em>illegal</em> immigrant, which is false.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 95: The Government will pay ACORN and Americorps to sign up individuals for Government-run Health Care plan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>False: </strong>This page is the start of “SEC. 205. OUTREACH AND ENROLLMENT OF EXCHANGE-ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS AND EMPLOYERS IN EXCHANGE-PARTICIPATING HEALTH BENEFITS PLAN.” It says a newly established Health Choices Commissioner “shall conduct outreach activities” to get people covered by private or government health insurance plans. The section says on page 97 that the Commissioner “may work with other appropriate entities to facilitate … provision of information.” But there is no authorization anywhere in the entire section for the Commissioner to pay money to any group to engage in outreach.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 102: Those eligible for Medicaid will be automatically enrolled: you have no choice in the matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Partly true.</strong> Page 102 says certain Medicaid-eligible persons will be “automatically enrolled” in Medicaid (which is the state-federal program to provide insurance to low-income workers and families) IF they are not already covered by private insurance. That would happen only if they had “not elected to enroll” in one of the private plans offered through the new insurance exchanges, however. So on paper at least, they would have a choice. Also, it’s <a href=\"http://www.kff.org/uninsured/upload/7613.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">estimated</a> that one in four persons who lacks health insurance is already eligible for Medicaid or its offshoot, the state Children’s Health Insurance Program, but simply haven’t signed up or been enrolled by their parents.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 124: No company can sue the government for price-fixing. No “judicial review” is permitted against the government monopoly. Put simply, private insurers will be crushed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Half true.</strong> It’s true that page 124 forbids any review by the courts of rates the government would pay to doctors and hospitals under the new “public option” insurance plan. But there’s no mention of “price fixing” in the bill; that’s the e-mail author’s phrase. It also remains to be seen if the “public option” plan would grow to become a “government monopoly,” as the author predicts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 127: The AMA sold doctors out: the government will set wages.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Misleading.</strong> Nothing in the bill would “set wages” for doctors in general. Page 127 says the government would ask doctors to accept below-market rates set by the government for their patients who are covered by a new “public health insurance option,” just as they now are asked to do so for patients covered by Medicare. Physicians would still be free to charge what they wish for other patients, and free not to accept patients covered by the new program just as they are now free to refuse Medicare patients. That’s not a choice many doctors make, however, so as a practical matter the government would be setting rates (not “wages”) for many patients. On the other hand, the new “public” plan is aimed mainly at covering people who have no insurance now and can afford to pay doctors little if anything.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 145: An employer MUST auto-enroll employees into the government-run public plan. No alternatives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>False.</strong> It’s true that employers would be required to sign up their workers for coverage automatically, but it doesn’t have to be the “public plan.” It would be the employer-offered plan “with the lowest applicable employee premium” (pages 147- 148). This would only be the “public option” if the employer was eligible to buy coverage through the Health Insurance Exchange (not likely, at least during the first two years when only small businesses would have access), and the “public option” was the cheapest plan (which would be likely). Furthermore, while the employer isn’t given an alternative, the workers are. They may reject auto-enrollment under an opt-out provision (page 148).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 146: Employers MUST pay healthcare bills for part-time employees AND their families.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Half true.</strong> There’s nothing in this section about part-time employees’ families, but this provision does call for employers to contribute toward part-time employees’ health insurance. The bill says that “for an employee who is not a full-time employee … the amount of the minimum employer contribution” will be a proportion of the minimum contribution for full-time employees. This proportion will depend on the average weekly hours of part-time employees compared with the minimum weekly hours required to be a full-time employee, as specified by the Health Choices Commissioner. (For a point of reference: The minimum contribution for individual plans of full-time employees is not less than 72.5 percent of the premium of the cheapest plan the employer offers.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 149: Any employer with a payroll of $400K or more, who does not offer the public option, pays an 8% tax on payroll <strong>Claim: </strong>Page 150: Any employer with a payroll of $250K-400K or more, who does not offer the public option, pays a 2 to 6% tax on payroll.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Both Partly True. </strong>The bill requires employers either to offer private health insurance coverage or pay a percentage of their payroll expenses to help finance a public plan. The 8 percent payment would indeed apply to employers with payrolls over $400,000 in the previous year, and lesser amounts would apply to smaller firms. Those with payrolls of $250,000 or less would pay nothing. But the penalty isn’t incurred if an employer “does not offer the public option,” as the e-mail claims. Rather, it’s a penalty for not offering health insurance to employees.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 167: Any individual who doesn’t have acceptable health care (according to the government) will be taxed 2.5% of income.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>True. </strong>This is the mechanism in the bill to enforce the individual mandate requiring everyone to have insurance. A person who doesn’t have insurance that meets minimum benefit standards (or other acceptable coverage, such as a plan that was grandfathered in) would pay a penalty of 2.5 percent of modified adjusted gross income for the year. The total penalty can’t exceed a national average premium for individual coverage, or family coverage if applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 170: Any NON-RESIDENT alien is exempt from individual taxes (Americans will pay for them).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>False.</strong> “Non-resident aliens” are generally those who have spent less than 31 days in the U.S. during the year. The claim that “Americans will pay for them” assumes that such visitors would somehow be getting federal benefits that would cost taxpayers money. In any case, they are not “exempt from individual taxes” at all. Under current law, the Internal Revenue Service says: “If you are a nonresident alien, you must file Form 1040NR (PDF) or Form 1040NR-EZ (PDF) if you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States, or have any other U.S. source income on which the tax was not fully paid by the amount withheld.” All that page 170 says is that non-resident aliens who don’t obtain health coverage don’t have to pay an additional 2.5 percent federal tax that would apply to U.S. workers who fail to get coverage, or to immigrants who are working here legally under green cards and who fail to obtain coverage. The tax is spelled out in subsection (a) starting on page 167.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 195: Officers and employees of Government Health care Bureaucracy will have access to ALL American financial and personal records.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>False. </strong>This section of the bill discusses “Disclosures To Carry Out Health Insurance Exchange Subsidies.” It says that government employees of the health insurance exchange will have access to federal tax information for purposes of determining eligibility for affordability credits available for low- and moderate-income Americans. In other words, in order to qualify for a government subsidy to purchase health insurance, the government needs to confirm your income. And, no surprise, the government already has access to your federal tax information. The bill also says nothing about “ALL … financial and personal records.” Instead it says “Such return information shall be limited to—(i) taxpayer identity information with respect to such taxpayer, (ii) the filing status of such taxpayer, (iii) the modified adjusted gross income of such taxpayer (as defined in section 59B(e)(5)), (iv) the number of dependents of the taxpayer, (v) such other information as is prescribed by the Secretary by regulation as might indicate whether the taxpayer is eligible for such affordability credits (and the amount thereof).” The bill goes on to limit use of this information “only for the purposes of, and to the extent necessary in, establishing and verifying the appropriate amount of any affordability credit … and providing for the repayment of any such credit which was in excess of such appropriate amount.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 203: “The tax imposed under this section shall not be treated as tax.” Yes, it really says that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Misleading.</strong> What this actually says is: “The tax imposed under this section shall not be treated as tax imposed by this chapter <em>for purposes of determining the amount of any credit under this chapter or for purposes of <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/#SECTIONS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">section 55</a></em>,” which deals with the Alternative Minimum Tax. It would limit the ripple effects of the new taxes the bill would impose on individuals making over $350,000 a year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 239: Bill will reduce physician services for Medicaid. Seniors and the poor most affected. <strong>Claim: </strong>Page 241: Doctors: no matter what specialty you have, you’ll all be paid the same (thanks, AMA!)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Both False.</strong> Both of these claims pertain to Section 1121, which updates the physician fee schedule for 2010 for Medicare. It doesn’t “reduce physician services for Medicaid” (which wouldn’t pertain to seniors anyway); instead it modifies a section of the Social Security Act that defines physicians’ services. The section also doesn’t say that doctors will be paid the same “no matter what specialty you have.” Instead it sets up two categories of physician services with different growth rates for fees under those categories. As the Kaiser Family Foundation <a href=\"http://www.kff.org/healthreform/upload/7948.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">says</a> of this section of the bill: “Allows the revised formula to be updated by the gross domestic product (GDP) plus 2% for evaluation and management services and GDP plus 1% for all other services.” The measure will cost $228.5 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 253: Government sets value of doctors’ time, their professional judgment, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Misleading. </strong>It’s true that page 253 refers to “relative value units” to be used when determining payment rates for doctor’s services, and that such RVUs would weigh factors “such as time, mental effort and professional judgment, technical skill and physical effort, and stress due to risk.” But this is nothing new; the government already uses RVUs when setting rates it will pay under Medicare. For example, the <a href=\"http://www.nhpf.org/library/the-basics/Basics_RVUs_02-12-09.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">RVUs </a>assigned to a colonoscopy are currently double the RVUs assigned to an intermediate office visit. In fact, page 253 is part of a section (Sec. 1122) that sets up a process for correcting existing but “potentially misvalued” rates.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 265: Government mandates and controls productivity for private healthcare industries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Misleading. </strong>This claim doesn’t even make sense. How can anyone “mandate” that somebody else be productive, or “control” how productive they are? The author has simply misunderstood what this controversial item would do. In fact, page 265 is the start of a section (Sec. 1131) that is among several designed to slow future growth of Medicare payments to help offset the cost of the bill. It would require that “productivity improvements” be taken into account when setting annual “market basket” updates to Medicare rates for hospital-based services. The hospital industry <a href=\"http://www.haponline.org/downloads/AHA_Fact_Sheets_Regarding_Medicare_Market_Basket_and_Public_Plan_Option.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">has estimated</a> this would translate into a 1.3 percent cut next year and a total of $150 billion in reduced payments over 10 years, and is opposed to it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 268: Government regulates rental and purchase of power-driven wheelchairs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Misleading. </strong>What page 268 does is to stop Medicare for paying for “mobility scooters,” which have been <a href=\"http://www.thescooterstore.com/mobility/spur/ppc/Scooter05/?code=INT806GP11&amp;p=8663655052&amp;lt=ppc&amp;gclid=CJu4-KuAwpwCFdND5godBi_0mw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">widely marketed</a> as a Medicare-financed benefit, leading to <a href=\"http://gao.gov/products/GAO-05-43\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">ballooning costs</a> to the program. They would no longer qualify as a “power-driven wheelchair.” Only a “complex rehabilitative power-driven wheel chair recognized by the Secretary” would be covered. The Congressional Budget Office <a href=\"http://cbo.gov/ftpdocs/104xx/doc10464/hr3200.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">estimates</a> this will save the government $800 million over 10 years (see page 2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 272: Cancer patients: welcome to the wonderful world of rationing!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>False. </strong>This page merely calls for a study of whether a certain class of hospitals incur higher costs than some others for the cancer care they deliver. It also says the secretary of HHS “shall provide for an appropriate adjustment” in payments “to reflect those higher costs.” It’s hardly “rationing” to pay hospitals more to compensate for higher costs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 280: Hospitals will be penalized for what the government deems preventable re-admissions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>True: </strong>This does say that “the Secretary shall reduce the payments” to hospitals with too many “potentially preventable” readmissions of patients that they previously had discharged.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 298: Doctors: if you treat a patient during an initial admission that results in a readmission, you will be penalized by the government.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>False. </strong>That section is part of a list of <em>potential</em> physician-centered approaches to reducing excess hospital readmissions. The bill states that the secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on the best ways to enforce readmissions policies with physicians. One of the approaches the secretary must consider is the option to reduce payments to physicians whose treatment results in a hospital readmission. Another is the option to <em>increase</em> payments to physicians who check up on recently released patients. Neither of these approaches is mandated in the bill – what’s mandated is that the secretary consider them, among others.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 317: Doctors: you are now prohibited for owning and investing in healthcare companies!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>False. </strong>It’s <a href=\"http://www.cms.hhs.gov/PhysicianSelfReferral/Downloads/section_1877.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">already illegal</a>, with certain exceptions, for doctors to refer Medicare patients to hospitals, labs, medical imaging facilities or other such medical businesses in which they hold a financial interest. Page 317 would modify an exception to that “self-referral prohibition” for rural providers, and says doctors can’t increase their stake in an exempt hospital after the bill becomes law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 318: Prohibition on hospital expansion. Hospitals cannot expand without government approval.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>False. </strong>Expansion is forbidden only for rural, doctor-owned hospitals that have been given a waiver from the general prohibition on self-referral. It does not apply to hospitals in general. The bill provides for exceptions to even this limited expansion ban (page 321).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 321: Hospital expansion hinges on “community” input: in other words, yet another payoff for ACORN.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>False. </strong>Page 321 says rural, doctor-owned hospitals that are exempt from the Medicaid self-referral prohibition can ask to be allowed to expand under rules that must allow “input” from “persons or entities in the community.” Under that language, anybody in the community could offer their opinion, but nobody – not ACORN or anybody else – would be paid for it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 335: Government mandates establishment of outcome-based measures: i.e., rationing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Misleading. </strong>This section does deal with establishing quality measures for Medicare. It does not make any recommendations for treatment, or empower anyone to make treatment recommendations based on those measures. The only effect of these outcome-based measures established in the bill would be ranking and potential disqualification of underperforming Medicare Advantage plans – that’s disqualification of the plans, not of any medical procedures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 341: Government has authority to disqualify Medicare Advantage Plans, HMOs, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>True.</strong> The bill allows for the possibility of disqualifying underperforming Medicare Advantage plans, which include Medicare HMOs. Medicare Advantage plans are private health plans that provide Medicare benefits. Under the bill, the secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to disallow plans that are providing low-quality care under the new quality measures (which include evaluations of patient health, mortality, safety and quality of life). If a plan is disqualified, this will not leave seniors without care. The Kaiser Family Foundation <a href=\"http://www.kff.org/medicare/upload/7775.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">reports</a> that “virtually all” Medicare beneficiaries have access to at least two Medicare Advantage plans, and most have access to three or more. In 2008, 82 percent of beneficiaries had access to six or more private fee-for-service plans, one type of Medicare Advantage plan (along with HMOs, PPOs and medical spending accounts). Beneficiaries are also always free to return to the regular Medicare fee-for-service program.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 354: Government will restrict enrollment of SPECIAL NEEDS individuals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Misleading.</strong> Insurance companies <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1859.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">already restrict</a> enrollment in so-called <a href=\"http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SpecialNeedsPlans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">“special needs” plans</a>, a special category of Medicare Advantage plans that were created in 2003. Page 354 merely extends the authority to do that beyond the end of next year, when it was set to expire. Furthermore, what’s being restricted isn’t the number of patients, but the type of patients. Plans can be restricted to accepting only those patients who fall into in one or more special categories. These include those who are institutionalized (think, nursing homes), those who qualify both for Medicare and Medicaid (think, both low-income and over age 65) and those with severe or disabling chronic conditions such as diabetes, emphysema, chronic heart failure or dementia. And of course, this has nothing to do with children with learning problems.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 379: More bureaucracy: Telehealth Advisory Committee (healthcare by phone).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Misleading.</strong> The advisory committee would not be a “bureaucracy” or have any administrative functions, but instead would bring together experts from the private sector to give advice on how Medicare and Medicaid should treat the practice of <a href=\"http://www.telehealthlawcenter.org/content/?page=18\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">medicine via telecommunication</a>, something used in rural hospitals and such places as cruise ships, battlefield settings and even on NASA space missions. Pages 380-381 call for the committee to consist of five “practicing physicians,” two “practicing non-physician health care workers” and two “administrators of telehealth programs.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim:</strong> Page 425: More bureaucracy: Advance Care Planning Consult: Senior Citizens, assisted suicide, euthanasia? <strong>Claim: </strong>Page 425: Government will instruct and consult regarding living wills, durable powers of attorney, etc. Mandatory. Appears to lock in estate taxes ahead of time. <strong>Claim: </strong>Page 425: Government provides approved list of end-of-life resources, guiding you in death <strong>Claim:</strong> Page 427: Government mandates program that orders end-of-life treatment; government dictates how your life ends. <strong>Claim:</strong> Page 429: Advance Care Planning Consult will be used to dictate treatment as patient’s health deteriorates. This can include an ORDER for end-of-life plans. An ORDER from the GOVERNMENT. <strong>Claim:</strong> Page 430: Government will decide what level of treatments you may have at end-of-life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>All False.</strong> These six claims are a twisted interpretation of a provision in the bill that says Medicare will cover <em>voluntary</em> counseling sessions between seniors and their doctors to discuss end-of-life care. Medicare doesn’t pay for such sessions now; it would under the bill. End-of-life care discussions include talking about a living will, hospice care, designating a health care proxy and making decisions on what care you want to receive at the end of your life. Doctors do the consulting, not the “government” or a “bureaucracy.” The e-mail author’s assertion that the bill calls for “an ORDER from the GOVERNMENT” for end-of-life plans rests on language about _a patient _drawing up such an order stipulating their wishes, and having that order signed by a physician. There’s nothing about “an order from the government.” The bill defines an order for life-sustaining treatment as a document that “is signed and dated by a physician …[and] effectively communicates the individual’s preferences regarding life sustaining treatment.” See our article “<a href=\"http://factcheck.org/2009/07/false-euthanasia-claims/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">False Euthanasia Claims</a>“ for more on such assertions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 469: Community-based Home Medical Services: more payoffs for ACORN.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>False.</strong> This section defines the term “community-based medical home” as a “nonprofit community-based or State-based organization” that “provides beneficiaries with medical home services.” ACORN does not provide medical home services. The section goes on to say such a medical service is one that “employs community health workers, including nurses or other non-physician practitioners, lay health workers, or other persons as determined appropriate by the Secretary, that assist the primary or principal care physician or nurse practitioner in chronic care management activities.” The only thing <a href=\"http://www.acorn.org/index.php?id=12342&amp;L=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">ACORN</a> has in common with that description is the word “community.” It’s a community organization that offers services such as free tax preparation help and first-time home buyer counseling for low- and moderate-income people. It also works to register people to vote, and a few of its canvassers have been investigated for registration fraud, a <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/acorn_accusations.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">point of concern</a> during the presidential campaign.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 472: Payments to Community-based organizations: more payoffs for ACORN.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>False. </strong>This section is referring to community-based medical homes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 489: Government will cover marriage and family therapy. Government intervenes in your marriage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Half true.</strong> It’s true that pages 489 and 490 make state-licensed “marriage and family therapist” services a covered expense “for the diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses.” But the therapists wouldn’t be employed by the government, and there’s no requirement for anybody to receive their help. So the claim that this would mean that “government intervenes in your marriage” is false.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim: </strong>Page 494: Government will cover mental health services: defining, creating and rationing those services.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Misleading.</strong> The provision amends <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1861.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Section 1861 of the Social Security Act </a>laying out what services Medicare will cover. It expands coverage for mental health services, stipulating that a “mental health counselor” who can perform mental health counseling is someone with a master’s or doctorate degree, a state license, and two years of practice as a counselor. Is this the government “defining” mental health services? Well, it’s certainly the government defining what government programs will cover.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>– by Brooks Jackson, Lori Robertson and Jess Henig, with D’Angelo Gore</em></p>\n","source":"_posts/twenty-six-lies-about-h-r-3200.markdown","raw":"---\nauthor: phil\ncomments: true\ndate: 2009-09-09 08:29:32\nlayout: post\nslug: twenty-six-lies-about-h-r-3200\ntitle: Twenty-six Lies About H.R. 3200\nwordpress_id: 1729\ncategories:\n- commentary\n- featured\n- headline\n- parenting\n- politics\ntags:\n- barack obama\n- health\n- politics\n---\n\n![factcheck_thumb](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/factcheck_thumb.jpg)With all the craziness around the health care debate, the facts are getting lost.  There is simply no way we're going to have a productive conversation on the issues when the facts are not known or heeded.  There is a great article on [Factcheck.org](http://wordpress.asc.upenn.edu) that debunks many of the non-truths that are being thrown around as justification for calling people Nazis.  Let's grow up and figure out a way to see both sides without name calling, please review these and expose them to others who are not using facts in their arguments.<!-- more -->\n\n\n> \n\n> \n> \n\n> \n> \n\n> \n> # Twenty-six Lies About H.R. 3200\n> \n> \nA notorious analysis of the House health care bill contains 48 claims.

The chain e-mail purports to give \"a few highlights\" from the first half of the bill, but the list of 48 assertions is filled with falsehoods, exaggerations and misinterpretations. We examined each of the e-mail’s claims, finding 26 of them to be false and 18 to be misleading, only partly true or half true. Only four are accurate. A few of our \"highlights\":\n\n> \n> \n\t\n>   * The e-mail claims that page 30 of the bill says that \"a government committee will decide what treatments … you get,\" but that page refers to a \"private-public advisory committee\" that would \"recommend\" what minimum benefits would be included in basic, enhanced and premium insurance plans.\n> \n\t\n>   * The e-mail says that \"non-US citizens, illegal or not, will be provided with free healthcare services\" but points to a provision that prohibits discrimination in health care based on \"personal characteristics.\" Another provision explicity forbids \"federal payment for undocumented aliens.\"\n> \n\t\n>   * It says \"[g]overnment will restrict enrollment of SPECIAL NEEDS individuals.\" This provision isn’t about children with learning disabilities; instead, it pertains to restricted enrollment in \"special needs\" plans, a category of Medicare Advantage plans. Enrollment is already restricted. The bill extends the ability to do that.\n> \n\t\n>   * It claims that a section about \"Community-based Home Medical Services\" means \"more payoffs for ACORN.\" ACORN does not provide medical home services. The e-mail interprets any reference to the word \"community\" to be some kind of payoff for ACORN. That’s nonsense.\n> \n\n\n> \n> ## **Analysis**\n> \n> \nThis chain e-mail claims to give a run-down of what’s in the House health care bill, [H.R. 3200](http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:h3200ih.txt.pdf). Instead, it shows evidence of a reading comprehension problem on the part of the author. Some of our more enterprising readers have even taken it upon themselves to debunk a few of the assertions, sending us their notes and encouraging us to write about it.

Curtis Blackwood, published a version of the e-mail in a newsletter to constituents, telling them that while going through e-mail, he came across \"some interesting information on the Democrats’ big health care bill, H.R. 3200. … While this is federal legislation and not state, the topic is of enough significance that I thought many of you would be interested in reading it.\" We’d refer Rep. Blackwood to our special report on viral messages titled, \"[That Chain E-mail Your Friend Sent to You Is (Likely) Bogus. Seriously](http://www.factcheck.org/2008/03/that-chain-e-mail-your-friend-sent-to-you-is-likely-bogus-seriously/).\"\n\nWe can trace the origins of this collection of claims to [a conservative blogger](http://blog.flecksoflife.com/2009/07/19/the-hc-monstrosity/) who issued his instant and mostly mistaken analyses as brief \"tweets\" sent via Twitter as he was paging through the 1,017-page bill. The claims have been embraced as true and posted on hundreds of Web sites, and forwarded in the form of chain e-mails countless times. But there’s hardly any truth in them. We’ll go through each of the claims in this message:\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 22: Mandates audits of all employers that self-insure!\n> \n> \n**False: **This section merely requires a study of “the large group insured and self-insured employer health care markets.” There’s no mention of auditing employers, only of studying “markets.” The purpose of the study is to produce “recommendations” to make sure the new law “does not provide incentives for small and mid-size employers to self-insure.”\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 29: Admission: your health care will be rationed!\n> \n> \n**False: **This section says nothing whatsoever about “rationing” or anything of the sort. Actually, it’s favorable to families and individuals, placing an annual cap on what they could pay out of pocket if covered by a basic, “essential benefits package.” The limits would be $5,000 for an individual, $10,000 for a family.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 30: A government committee will decide what treatments and benefits you get (and, unlike an insurer, there will be no appeals process)\n> \n> \n**False: **Actually, the section starting on page 30 sets up a “private-public advisory committee” headed by the U.S. surgeon general and made up of mostly private sector “medical and other experts” selected by the president and the comptroller general. The advisory committee would have only the power “to recommend” what benefits are included in basic, enhanced and premium insurance plans. It would have no power to decide what treatments anybody will get. Its recommendations on benefits might or might not be adopted.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 42: The “Health Choices Commissioner” will decide health benefits for you. You will have no choice. None.\n> \n> \n**False: **The new Health Choices Commissioner will oversee a variety of choices to be offered through new insurance exchanges. The bill itself specifies the “minimum services to be covered” in a basic plan, including prescription drugs, mental health services, maternity and well-baby care and certain vaccines and preventive services (pages 27-28). We find nothing in the bill that prevents insurance companies from offering benefits that exceed the minimums. In fact, the legislation allows (page 84) any company that offers an approved basic plan to offer also an “enhanced” plan, a “premium” plan and even a “premium plus” plan that could include vision and dental benefits.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 50: All non-US citizens, illegal or not, will be provided with free healthcare services.\n> \n> \n**False.** That’s simply not what the bill says at all. This page includes \"SEC. 152. PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION IN HEALTH CARE,\" which says that \"[e]xcept as otherwise explicitly permitted by this Act and by subsequent regulations consistent with this Act, all health care and related services (including insurance coverage and public health activities) covered by this Act shall be provided without regard to personal characteristics extraneous to the provision of high quality health care or related services.\" However, the bill does explicitly say that illegal immigrants can’t get any government money to pay for health care. Page 143 states: \"Nothing in this subtitle shall allow Federal payments for affordability credits on behalf of individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States.\" And as [we’ve said before](http://factcheck.org/2009/07/misleading-gop-health-care-claims/), current law prohibits illegal immigrants from participating in government health care programs.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 58: Every person will be issued a National ID Healthcard.\n> \n> \n**False. **There is no mention of any “National ID Healthcard” anywhere in the bill. Page 58 says that government standards for electronic medical transactions \"may include utilization of a machine-readable health plan beneficiary identification card,” to show eligibility for services. Insurance companies typically issue such cards already, but if such a standard were issued the cards would need to be in a standard form readable by computers. The word “may” is used to permit such a standard, but it does not require one.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 59: The federal government will have direct, real-time access to all individual bank accounts for electronic funds transfer.\n> \n> \n**False. **This section aims to simplify electronic payments for health services, the same sort of electronic payments that already are common for such things as utility bills or mortgage payments. The bill calls for the secretary of Health and Human Services to set standards for electronic administrative transactions that would \"enable electronic funds transfers, in order to allow automated reconciliation with the related health care payment and remittance advice.\" There is no mention of \"individual bank accounts\" nor of any new government authority over them. Also, the section does not say that electronic payments from consumers is required.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 65: Taxpayers will subsidize all union retiree and community organizer health plans (read: SEIU, UAW and ACORN)\n> \n> \n**Misleading.** Page 65 is the start of a section (SEC. 164. REINSURANCE PROGRAM FOR RETIREES) that would set up a new federal reinsurance plan to benefit retirees and spouses covered by _any _employer plan, not just those run by labor unions or nonprofit groups. Specifically, it covers “retirees and . . . spouses, surviving spouses and dependents of such retirees” who are covered by “employment-based plans” that provide health benefits. It’s open to any “group health benefits plan that . . . is maintained by one or more employers, former employers or employee associations,” as well as voluntary employees’ beneficiary associations (page 66). Furthermore, the aim of the fund is to cut premiums, copays and deductibles for the retirees. Payment “shall not be used to reduce the costs of an employer.”\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 72: All private healthcare plans must conform to government rules to participate in a Healthcare Exchange.\n> \n> \n**True.** This page begins a section setting up a new, national Health Insurance Exchange through which individuals and employers may choose from a variety of private insurance plans, much like the system that now covers millions of federal workers. Any private insurance plans offered through this exchange must meet new federal standards. For example, such plans can’t deny coverage for preexisting medical conditions (page 19).\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 84: All private healthcare plans must participate in the Health care Exchange (i.e., total government control of private plans)\n> \n> \n**Partly true.** Nothing like this appears on page 84. No insurance company is required to sell plans through the exchange if it doesn’t want to. Any employer may choose to buy coverage elsewhere. In fact, the vast majority of employers will still be buying private plans through the normal marketplace, because only employers with 10 or fewer employees are even allowed to buy through the exchange in the first year. The limit rises to 20 employees in the second year. However, new plans sold directly to individuals will only be sold through the exchange. Individuals who currently buy their own coverage can keep those plans if they wish, and if the insurance company continues to offer them.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 91: Government mandates linguistic infrastructure for services; translation: illegal aliens\n> \n> \n**Misleading.** It’s true that page 91 says that insurance companies selling plans through the new exchange “shall provide for culturally and linguistically appropriate communication and health services.” The author’s “translation,” however, assumes that anyone speaking a foreign language or from another culture is an _illegal_ immigrant, which is false.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 95: The Government will pay ACORN and Americorps to sign up individuals for Government-run Health Care plan.\n> \n> \n**False: **This page is the start of “SEC. 205. OUTREACH AND ENROLLMENT OF EXCHANGE-ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS AND EMPLOYERS IN EXCHANGE-PARTICIPATING HEALTH BENEFITS PLAN.” It says a newly established Health Choices Commissioner “shall conduct outreach activities” to get people covered by private or government health insurance plans. The section says on page 97 that the Commissioner “may work with other appropriate entities to facilitate … provision of information.” But there is no authorization anywhere in the entire section for the Commissioner to pay money to any group to engage in outreach.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 102: Those eligible for Medicaid will be automatically enrolled: you have no choice in the matter.\n> \n> \n**Partly true.** Page 102 says certain Medicaid-eligible persons will be “automatically enrolled” in Medicaid (which is the state-federal program to provide insurance to low-income workers and families) IF they are not already covered by private insurance. That would happen only if they had “not elected to enroll” in one of the private plans offered through the new insurance exchanges, however. So on paper at least, they would have a choice. Also, it’s [estimated](http://www.kff.org/uninsured/upload/7613.pdf) that one in four persons who lacks health insurance is already eligible for Medicaid or its offshoot, the state Children’s Health Insurance Program, but simply haven’t signed up or been enrolled by their parents.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 124: No company can sue the government for price-fixing. No “judicial review” is permitted against the government monopoly. Put simply, private insurers will be crushed.\n> \n> \n**Half true.** It’s true that page 124 forbids any review by the courts of rates the government would pay to doctors and hospitals under the new “public option” insurance plan. But there’s no mention of “price fixing” in the bill; that’s the e-mail author’s phrase. It also remains to be seen if the “public option” plan would grow to become a “government monopoly,” as the author predicts.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 127: The AMA sold doctors out: the government will set wages.\n> \n> \n**Misleading.** Nothing in the bill would “set wages” for doctors in general. Page 127 says the government would ask doctors to accept below-market rates set by the government for their patients who are covered by a new “public health insurance option,” just as they now are asked to do so for patients covered by Medicare. Physicians would still be free to charge what they wish for other patients, and free not to accept patients covered by the new program just as they are now free to refuse Medicare patients. That’s not a choice many doctors make, however, so as a practical matter the government would be setting rates (not “wages”) for many patients. On the other hand, the new “public” plan is aimed mainly at covering people who have no insurance now and can afford to pay doctors little if anything.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 145: An employer MUST auto-enroll employees into the government-run public plan. No alternatives.\n> \n> \n**False.** It’s true that employers would be required to sign up their workers for coverage automatically, but it doesn’t have to be the “public plan.” It would be the employer-offered plan “with the lowest applicable employee premium” (pages 147- 148). This would only be the \"public option\" if the employer was eligible to buy coverage through the Health Insurance Exchange (not likely, at least during the first two years when only small businesses would have access), and the \"public option\" was the cheapest plan (which would be likely). Furthermore, while the employer isn’t given an alternative, the workers are. They may reject auto-enrollment under an opt-out provision (page 148).\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 146: Employers MUST pay healthcare bills for part-time employees AND their families.\n> \n> \n**Half true.** There’s nothing in this section about part-time employees’ families, but this provision does call for employers to contribute toward part-time employees’ health insurance. The bill says that “for an employee who is not a full-time employee … the amount of the minimum employer contribution” will be a proportion of the minimum contribution for full-time employees. This proportion will depend on the average weekly hours of part-time employees compared with the minimum weekly hours required to be a full-time employee, as specified by the Health Choices Commissioner. (For a point of reference: The minimum contribution for individual plans of full-time employees is not less than 72.5 percent of the premium of the cheapest plan the employer offers.)\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 149: Any employer with a payroll of $400K or more, who does not offer the public option, pays an 8% tax on payroll **Claim: **Page 150: Any employer with a payroll of $250K-400K or more, who does not offer the public option, pays a 2 to 6% tax on payroll.\n> \n> \n**Both Partly True. **The bill requires employers either to offer private health insurance coverage or pay a percentage of their payroll expenses to help finance a public plan. The 8 percent payment would indeed apply to employers with payrolls over $400,000 in the previous year, and lesser amounts would apply to smaller firms. Those with payrolls of $250,000 or less would pay nothing. But the penalty isn’t incurred if an employer \"does not offer the public option,\" as the e-mail claims. Rather, it’s a penalty for not offering health insurance to employees.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 167: Any individual who doesn’t have acceptable health care (according to the government) will be taxed 2.5% of income.\n> \n> \n**True. **This is the mechanism in the bill to enforce the individual mandate requiring everyone to have insurance. A person who doesn’t have insurance that meets minimum benefit standards (or other acceptable coverage, such as a plan that was grandfathered in) would pay a penalty of 2.5 percent of modified adjusted gross income for the year. The total penalty can’t exceed a national average premium for individual coverage, or family coverage if applicable.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 170: Any NON-RESIDENT alien is exempt from individual taxes (Americans will pay for them).\n> \n> \n**False.** “Non-resident aliens” are generally those who have spent less than 31 days in the U.S. during the year. The claim that “Americans will pay for them” assumes that such visitors would somehow be getting federal benefits that would cost taxpayers money. In any case, they are not “exempt from individual taxes” at all. Under current law, the Internal Revenue Service says: “If you are a nonresident alien, you must file Form 1040NR (PDF) or Form 1040NR-EZ (PDF) if you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States, or have any other U.S. source income on which the tax was not fully paid by the amount withheld.” All that page 170 says is that non-resident aliens who don’t obtain health coverage don’t have to pay an additional 2.5 percent federal tax that would apply to U.S. workers who fail to get coverage, or to immigrants who are working here legally under green cards and who fail to obtain coverage. The tax is spelled out in subsection (a) starting on page 167.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 195: Officers and employees of Government Health care Bureaucracy will have access to ALL American financial and personal records.\n> \n> \n**False. **This section of the bill discusses “Disclosures To Carry Out Health Insurance Exchange Subsidies.” It says that government employees of the health insurance exchange will have access to federal tax information for purposes of determining eligibility for affordability credits available for low- and moderate-income Americans. In other words, in order to qualify for a government subsidy to purchase health insurance, the government needs to confirm your income. And, no surprise, the government already has access to your federal tax information. The bill also says nothing about “ALL … financial and personal records.” Instead it says “Such return information shall be limited to—(i) taxpayer identity information with respect to such taxpayer, (ii) the filing status of such taxpayer, (iii) the modified adjusted gross income of such taxpayer (as defined in section 59B(e)(5)), (iv) the number of dependents of the taxpayer, (v) such other information as is prescribed by the Secretary by regulation as might indicate whether the taxpayer is eligible for such affordability credits (and the amount thereof).” The bill goes on to limit use of this information “only for the purposes of, and to the extent necessary in, establishing and verifying the appropriate amount of any affordability credit … and providing for the repayment of any such credit which was in excess of such appropriate amount.”\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 203: “The tax imposed under this section shall not be treated as tax.” Yes, it really says that.\n> \n> \n**Misleading.** What this actually says is: “The tax imposed under this section shall not be treated as tax imposed by this chapter _for purposes of determining the amount of any credit under this chapter or for purposes of [section 55](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/#SECTIONS)_,” which deals with the Alternative Minimum Tax. It would limit the ripple effects of the new taxes the bill would impose on individuals making over $350,000 a year.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 239: Bill will reduce physician services for Medicaid. Seniors and the poor most affected. **Claim: **Page 241: Doctors: no matter what specialty you have, you’ll all be paid the same (thanks, AMA!)\n> \n> \n**Both False.** Both of these claims pertain to Section 1121, which updates the physician fee schedule for 2010 for Medicare. It doesn’t \"reduce physician services for Medicaid\" (which wouldn’t pertain to seniors anyway); instead it modifies a section of the Social Security Act that defines physicians’ services. The section also doesn’t say that doctors will be paid the same “no matter what specialty you have.” Instead it sets up two categories of physician services with different growth rates for fees under those categories. As the Kaiser Family Foundation [says](http://www.kff.org/healthreform/upload/7948.pdf) of this section of the bill: \"Allows the revised formula to be updated by the gross domestic product (GDP) plus 2% for evaluation and management services and GDP plus 1% for all other services.\" The measure will cost $228.5 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 253: Government sets value of doctors’ time, their professional judgment, etc.\n> \n> \n**Misleading. **It’s true that page 253 refers to “relative value units” to be used when determining payment rates for doctor’s services, and that such RVUs would weigh factors “such as time, mental effort and professional judgment, technical skill and physical effort, and stress due to risk.” But this is nothing new; the government already uses RVUs when setting rates it will pay under Medicare. For example, the [RVUs ](http://www.nhpf.org/library/the-basics/Basics_RVUs_02-12-09.pdf)assigned to a colonoscopy are currently double the RVUs assigned to an intermediate office visit. In fact, page 253 is part of a section (Sec. 1122) that sets up a process for correcting existing but “potentially misvalued” rates.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 265: Government mandates and controls productivity for private healthcare industries.\n> \n> \n**Misleading. **This claim doesn’t even make sense. How can anyone \"mandate” that somebody else be productive, or “control” how productive they are? The author has simply misunderstood what this controversial item would do. In fact, page 265 is the start of a section (Sec. 1131) that is among several designed to slow future growth of Medicare payments to help offset the cost of the bill. It would require that “productivity improvements” be taken into account when setting annual “market basket” updates to Medicare rates for hospital-based services. The hospital industry [has estimated](http://www.haponline.org/downloads/AHA_Fact_Sheets_Regarding_Medicare_Market_Basket_and_Public_Plan_Option.pdf) this would translate into a 1.3 percent cut next year and a total of $150 billion in reduced payments over 10 years, and is opposed to it.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 268: Government regulates rental and purchase of power-driven wheelchairs.\n> \n> \n**Misleading. **What page 268 does is to stop Medicare for paying for “mobility scooters,” which have been [widely marketed](http://www.thescooterstore.com/mobility/spur/ppc/Scooter05/?code=INT806GP11&p=8663655052&lt=ppc&gclid=CJu4-KuAwpwCFdND5godBi_0mw) as a Medicare-financed benefit, leading to [ballooning costs](http://gao.gov/products/GAO-05-43) to the program. They would no longer qualify as a “power-driven wheelchair.” Only a \"complex rehabilitative power-driven wheel chair recognized by the Secretary” would be covered. The Congressional Budget Office [estimates](http://cbo.gov/ftpdocs/104xx/doc10464/hr3200.pdf) this will save the government $800 million over 10 years (see page 2).\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 272: Cancer patients: welcome to the wonderful world of rationing!\n> \n> \n**False. **This page merely calls for a study of whether a certain class of hospitals incur higher costs than some others for the cancer care they deliver. It also says the secretary of HHS “shall provide for an appropriate adjustment” in payments “to reflect those higher costs.” It’s hardly “rationing” to pay hospitals more to compensate for higher costs.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 280: Hospitals will be penalized for what the government deems preventable re-admissions.\n> \n> \n**True: **This does say that “the Secretary shall reduce the payments” to hospitals with too many “potentially preventable” readmissions of patients that they previously had discharged.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 298: Doctors: if you treat a patient during an initial admission that results in a readmission, you will be penalized by the government.\n> \n> \n**False. **That section is part of a list of _potential_ physician-centered approaches to reducing excess hospital readmissions. The bill states that the secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on the best ways to enforce readmissions policies with physicians. One of the approaches the secretary must consider is the option to reduce payments to physicians whose treatment results in a hospital readmission. Another is the option to _increase_ payments to physicians who check up on recently released patients. Neither of these approaches is mandated in the bill – what’s mandated is that the secretary consider them, among others.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 317: Doctors: you are now prohibited for owning and investing in healthcare companies!\n> \n> \n**False. **It’s [already illegal](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/PhysicianSelfReferral/Downloads/section_1877.pdf), with certain exceptions, for doctors to refer Medicare patients to hospitals, labs, medical imaging facilities or other such medical businesses in which they hold a financial interest. Page 317 would modify an exception to that “self-referral prohibition” for rural providers, and says doctors can’t increase their stake in an exempt hospital after the bill becomes law.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 318: Prohibition on hospital expansion. Hospitals cannot expand without government approval.\n> \n> \n**False. **Expansion is forbidden only for rural, doctor-owned hospitals that have been given a waiver from the general prohibition on self-referral. It does not apply to hospitals in general. The bill provides for exceptions to even this limited expansion ban (page 321).\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 321: Hospital expansion hinges on “community” input: in other words, yet another payoff for ACORN.\n> \n> \n**False. **Page 321 says rural, doctor-owned hospitals that are exempt from the Medicaid self-referral prohibition can ask to be allowed to expand under rules that must allow “input” from “persons or entities in the community.” Under that language, anybody in the community could offer their opinion, but nobody – not ACORN or anybody else – would be paid for it.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 335: Government mandates establishment of outcome-based measures: i.e., rationing.\n> \n> \n**Misleading. **This section does deal with establishing quality measures for Medicare. It does not make any recommendations for treatment, or empower anyone to make treatment recommendations based on those measures. The only effect of these outcome-based measures established in the bill would be ranking and potential disqualification of underperforming Medicare Advantage plans – that’s disqualification of the plans, not of any medical procedures.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 341: Government has authority to disqualify Medicare Advantage Plans, HMOs, etc.\n> \n> \n**True.** The bill allows for the possibility of disqualifying underperforming Medicare Advantage plans, which include Medicare HMOs. Medicare Advantage plans are private health plans that provide Medicare benefits. Under the bill, the secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to disallow plans that are providing low-quality care under the new quality measures (which include evaluations of patient health, mortality, safety and quality of life). If a plan is disqualified, this will not leave seniors without care. The Kaiser Family Foundation [reports](http://www.kff.org/medicare/upload/7775.pdf) that “virtually all” Medicare beneficiaries have access to at least two Medicare Advantage plans, and most have access to three or more. In 2008, 82 percent of beneficiaries had access to six or more private fee-for-service plans, one type of Medicare Advantage plan (along with HMOs, PPOs and medical spending accounts). Beneficiaries are also always free to return to the regular Medicare fee-for-service program.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 354: Government will restrict enrollment of SPECIAL NEEDS individuals.\n> \n> \n**Misleading.** Insurance companies [already restrict](http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1859.htm) enrollment in so-called [“special needs” plans](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SpecialNeedsPlans/), a special category of Medicare Advantage plans that were created in 2003. Page 354 merely extends the authority to do that beyond the end of next year, when it was set to expire. Furthermore, what’s being restricted isn’t the number of patients, but the type of patients. Plans can be restricted to accepting only those patients who fall into in one or more special categories. These include those who are institutionalized (think, nursing homes), those who qualify both for Medicare and Medicaid (think, both low-income and over age 65) and those with severe or disabling chronic conditions such as diabetes, emphysema, chronic heart failure or dementia. And of course, this has nothing to do with children with learning problems.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 379: More bureaucracy: Telehealth Advisory Committee (healthcare by phone).\n> \n> \n**Misleading.** The advisory committee would not be a “bureaucracy” or have any administrative functions, but instead would bring together experts from the private sector to give advice on how Medicare and Medicaid should treat the practice of [medicine via telecommunication](http://www.telehealthlawcenter.org/content/?page=18), something used in rural hospitals and such places as cruise ships, battlefield settings and even on NASA space missions. Pages 380-381 call for the committee to consist of five “practicing physicians,” two “practicing non-physician health care workers” and two “administrators of telehealth programs.”\n\n>\n>> **Claim:** Page 425: More bureaucracy: Advance Care Planning Consult: Senior Citizens, assisted suicide, euthanasia? **Claim: **Page 425: Government will instruct and consult regarding living wills, durable powers of attorney, etc. Mandatory. Appears to lock in estate taxes ahead of time. **Claim: **Page 425: Government provides approved list of end-of-life resources, guiding you in death **Claim:** Page 427: Government mandates program that orders end-of-life treatment; government dictates how your life ends. **Claim:** Page 429: Advance Care Planning Consult will be used to dictate treatment as patient’s health deteriorates. This can include an ORDER for end-of-life plans. An ORDER from the GOVERNMENT. **Claim:** Page 430: Government will decide what level of treatments you may have at end-of-life.\n> \n> \n**All False.** These six claims are a twisted interpretation of a provision in the bill that says Medicare will cover _voluntary_ counseling sessions between seniors and their doctors to discuss end-of-life care. Medicare doesn’t pay for such sessions now; it would under the bill. End-of-life care discussions include talking about a living will, hospice care, designating a health care proxy and making decisions on what care you want to receive at the end of your life. Doctors do the consulting, not the \"government\" or a \"bureaucracy.\" The e-mail author’s assertion that the bill calls for \"an ORDER from the GOVERNMENT\" for end-of-life plans rests on language about _a patient _drawing up such an order stipulating their wishes, and having that order signed by a physician. There’s nothing about \"an order from the government.\" The bill defines an order for life-sustaining treatment as a document that \"is signed and dated by a physician …[and] effectively communicates the individual’s preferences regarding life sustaining treatment.\" See our article \"[False Euthanasia Claims](http://factcheck.org/2009/07/false-euthanasia-claims/)\" for more on such assertions.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 469: Community-based Home Medical Services: more payoffs for ACORN.\n> \n> \n**False.** This section defines the term \"community-based medical home\" as a \"nonprofit community-based or State-based organization\" that \"provides beneficiaries with medical home services.\" ACORN does not provide medical home services. The section goes on to say such a medical service is one that \"employs community health workers, including nurses or other non-physician practitioners, lay health workers, or other persons as determined appropriate by the Secretary, that assist the primary or principal care physician or nurse practitioner in chronic care management activities.\" The only thing [ACORN](http://www.acorn.org/index.php?id=12342&L=0) has in common with that description is the word \"community.\" It’s a community organization that offers services such as free tax preparation help and first-time home buyer counseling for low- and moderate-income people. It also works to register people to vote, and a few of its canvassers have been investigated for registration fraud, a [point of concern](http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/acorn_accusations.html) during the presidential campaign.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 472: Payments to Community-based organizations: more payoffs for ACORN.\n> \n> \n**False. **This section is referring to community-based medical homes.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 489: Government will cover marriage and family therapy. Government intervenes in your marriage.\n> \n> \n**Half true.** It’s true that pages 489 and 490 make state-licensed “marriage and family therapist” services a covered expense “for the diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses.” But the therapists wouldn’t be employed by the government, and there’s no requirement for anybody to receive their help. So the claim that this would mean that “government intervenes in your marriage” is false.\n\n>\n>> **Claim: **Page 494: Government will cover mental health services: defining, creating and rationing those services.\n> \n> \n**Misleading.** The provision amends [Section 1861 of the Social Security Act ](http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1861.htm)laying out what services Medicare will cover. It expands coverage for mental health services, stipulating that a \"mental health counselor\" who can perform mental health counseling is someone with a master’s or doctorate degree, a state license, and two years of practice as a counselor. Is this the government \"defining\" mental health services? Well, it’s certainly the government defining what government programs will cover.\n\n_– by Brooks Jackson, Lori Robertson and Jess Henig, with D’Angelo Gore_\n","updated":1414378977000,"excerpt":"<p><img src=\"http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/factcheck_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"factcheck_thumb\">With all the craziness around the health care debate, the facts are getting lost.

Att N. Dolph” written on the label. He purchased the three records for 75 cents each.</em>“So the skinny on the recording is that this acetate is the recording of what would have been VU’s first album, <em>Velvet Underground with Nico</em>, as Andy Warhol recorded it.

Maybe this time I’ll slow dance with Tiffany Pfeiffer. Maybe this time I’ll find a first edition of Thomas Pynchon’s <em>The Crying of Lot 49</em>. Maybe my life will change within the hour.And so earlier this year, with flickering expectation, Warren Hill picked through some old records at a yard sale in Chelsea, New York. They seemed out of place compared with the rest the junk, like a box that had been forgotten in the attic and left untouched by a string of disinterested tenants. He pulled out a soggy copy of the Modern Lovers’ first LP and then he saw it, a record with no sleeve and only a few hand-written words on the label: “Velvet Underground… 4/25/66… N.

The Exploding Plastic Inevitable, a music-art-freak-out-happening, was the collaborative effort of Andy Warhol, his Factory followers, and the Velvet Underground. Epic versions of songs like “All Tomorrow’s Parties” were played at deafening volumes, dancers cracked whips, colored strobe lights flashed, and projected films drenched the audience, the walls, and the band in broken images of Edie Sedgwick’s face.</p>\n<p>Warhol was keen to capitalize on the buzz surrounding the events. In hopes of maintaining the band’s abrasive sound and seedy subject matter, he saw the need for a completed record, one that could be given to record labels without allowing them creative control. In exchange for one of his paintings, Warhol asked a sales executive at Columbia Records to oversee a one-day recording session at the dilapidated Scepter Studios. He would not be credited as a producer, but he would play an integral part in the Velvet Underground’s earliest studio recordings. That man’s name was Norman Dolph.</p>\n<p>On a single day in April, Dolph sat behind Scepter’s mixing boards as the band recorded what they thought would be their first record. Dolph had an acetate (a metallic “master” record) pressed after-hours at Columbia and sent it to the executives at the label. He still has the handwritten response he received when the acetate was returned, one he has paraphrased as, “You have to be fucking kidding!”</p>\n<p>After the initial rejection, the band would enlist another “ghost” producer, Tom Wilson, re-recording some of the songs and adding others. Eventually, all the master tapes would be re-mixed by Wilson and the final product would be released as <em>The Velvet Underground and Nico</em>.</p>\n<p>THREE CHORDS, THE TRUTH, AND ONE EXPENSIVE RECORD</p>\n<p>Before returning home to Montreal, Warren Hill went to other sales and bought more records, but when he called longtime friend, Portland’s Mississippi Records’ owner Eric Isaacson, the mysterious Velvet Underground record seemed like the biggest find.</p>\n<p>“We assumed it was a test pressing at first,” recalls Isaacson. “I told Warren we could put an $800 price tag on it and put it on the wall at the store.”</p>\n<p>Once Hill brought the record to Portland, the two began to realize they were in for a bigger payday. The track list was different than the official record released by Verve, and a few songs were missing. The sound mix seemed weird and versions of some of the songs were markedly different than anything either had heard before.</p>\n<p>“You can damage acetates by playing them too much,” says Isaacson, “But I put it on anyway and right away we were like ‘Holy shit!’ We knew it was really important.”</p>\n<p>Hill tracked down the phone number for Norman Dolph and, after verifying the serial number, the former producer confirmed that it was the record he had pressed for Columbia executives. Because the original master tapes of the Scepter session have been lost or destroyed, it remains as a one-of-a-kind testament to the band’s first studio session, containing “lost” versions of “Venus in Furs,” “I’m Waiting for the Man,” and “Heroin.” The last time Dolph saw the record, it was collecting dust in Warhol’s estate. How it ended up in a Chelsea attic remains a mystery, as does its future.</p>\n<p>“We’re petrified and don’t really know how to sell it” says Isaacson. “We got an offer right away for $10,000, but we turned it down.”</p>\n<p>Not bad for a $0.75 investment. It now seems likely that the record will become the most expensive ever sold, exceeding the sale of Bob Dylan’s <em>Blonde on Blonde</em> acetate and topping $40,000. Like finding the U.S. Constitution behind a painting, it’s the kind of event that will drive yard sale attendance for years to come.</p>\n<p>The record now resides comfortably in a safe house at significant distance from <em>Mercury</em> readers.</p>\n","source":"_posts/ultra-rare-velvet-underground-vinyl-on-ebay-for-over-100k.markdown","raw":"---\nauthor: phil\ncomments: true\ndate: 2006-12-04 14:00:42\nlayout: post\nslug: ultra-rare-velvet-underground-vinyl-on-ebay-for-over-100k\ntitle: Ultra-rare Velvet Underground Vinyl on eBay for over $100K - DENIED\nwordpress_id: 266\ncategories:\n- music\ntags:\n- bands\n- lou reed\n- rock\n- rock and roll\n- velvet underground\n---\n\n[![Velvet Underground - eBay small](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/vu-sm.jpg)](http://cgi.ebay.com/VELVET-UNDERGROUND-NICO-1966-Acetate-LP-ANDY-WARHOL_W0QQitemZ300054910309QQihZ020QQcategoryZ306QQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem#ebayphotohosting)\n\n**UPDATE4**: The top bid(s) were bogus, and the auction ended without a buyer.

This week I am implementing Varnish to enhance an image server’s ability to scale and serve images online.</em></p>\n<p><strong>The Job</strong></p>\n<p>A client’s new ‘enterprise’ content management system proves to be far too slow to serve the multiple dynamic web sites that it’s scheduled to handle, and a reverse proxy was recommended by the company that sells the CMS to remedy the issue.</p>\n<p><strong>The Tool</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://varnish.projects.linpro.no/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Varnish</a> is an Open Source, state-of-the-art, high-performance HTTP accelerator. Varnish is targeted primarily at the FreeBSD 6+ and Linux 2.6 platforms, and will take full advantage of the virtual memory system and advanced I/O features offered by these operating systems. Unlike other reverse proxy solutions such as Squid, Varnish was written from the ground up to be a high performance caching reverse proxy, and has been praised for its speed, stability under load and use of system resources when compared to other solutions. At the client’s site we have setup Varnish, as well as Squid as reverse proxy solutions, both pointing to the same backend CMS, which in turn talks to an Oracle database. After many stress tests, the pattern remained the same. Typical results can be seen in the following graph which shows the results of stress test of 2500 requests with 40 concurrent users. The first column shows the CMS on its own for a base reading, then with Squid as a reverse proxy, and finally and with Varnish.

When I got there there was a flurry of activity, and I could tell people were there because they wanted to be.  As we waited for others to show up to get started, I saw a pile of boxes; they had just gotten in a huge shipment of yard signs, after being back ordered for weeks.  I think I built at least 50 of those in the half hour I worked on them, but then Laura came around with our assignment, “Who wants to knock on doors?”  I likely had a look of shock on my face, but still manged to say, “Great!”.  After all, even though I hate people coming to my door, and wasn’t looking forward to being on the other side, what place did I have to complain?  This is for something much bigger than that.  Fortunately the paperwork was really well organized, with the map and route all planned out.  I was paired up with another volunteer and we hit the road.  The canvasing went really well, most were very polite, regardless if they Obama supports or not (most were).  One thing about the neighborhood, it’s only about 15 minutes South of me, but there were absolutely no political signs anywhere, and it wasn’t the kind of neighborhood that  wouldn’t allow them, so it was very strange.  Most in my area are pretty outgoing about showing their affiliation and staying educated about the days events, I had the feeling things were different which made me all the more retisent to do a good job.  We walked the streets for a few hours and got more comfortable with the idea of banging on people’s doors as time went along.

When I got there there was a flurry of activity, and I could tell people were there because they wanted to be.  As we waited for others to show up to get started, I saw a pile of boxes; they had just gotten in a huge shipment of yard signs, after being back ordered for weeks.  I think I built at least 50 of those in the half hour I worked on them, but then Laura came around with our assignment, \"Who wants to knock on doors?\"  I likely had a look of shock on my face, but still manged to say, \"Great!\".  After all, even though I hate people coming to my door, and wasn't looking forward to being on the other side, what place did I have to complain?  This is for something much bigger than that.  Fortunately the paperwork was really well organized, with the map and route all planned out.  I was paired up with another volunteer and we hit the road.  The canvasing went really well, most were very polite, regardless if they Obama supports or not (most were).  One thing about the neighborhood, it's only about 15 minutes South of me, but there were absolutely no political signs anywhere, and it wasn't the kind of neighborhood that  wouldn't allow them, so it was very strange.  Most in my area are pretty outgoing about showing their affiliation and staying educated about the days events, I had the feeling things were different which made me all the more retisent to do a good job.  We walked the streets for a few hours and got more comfortable with the idea of banging on people's doors as time went along.  I think the fact that our contry is in such a crossroads made it much eaiser for me to participate, and I'm really glad I got to do it.  Now it's time to regroup and map out more time to help out at headquarters.  If anyone is hesitant about doing something like this, try it, I don't think you'll regret it.  Leave a message for me if you have any questions, or search for [your local field office and volunteer](http://my.barackobama.com/page/event/detail/localfieldoffice/4wkrk) - we're 40 days out - it's time for action.\n","updated":1414378977000,"excerpt":"","_id":"dodtcvqi65w2y82y","photos":[],"link":""},{"layout":"post","title":"Vote for your top 10 albums of 1986","date":1375901580000,"comments":true,"categories":["cqw66jld2sx6kyso"],"content":"<p>Alright, this is just a fun post, try to pick your top 10 albums from 1986.

Between our home stereo to my car cd player to my iPod; I have plenty of outlets to plug into.  For all the things I dig, the old DIY ethic holds a precious place in my heart.  Sure, even though I’m open to hip-hop, americana, jazz, or whatever tag you need to put on things, there’s something about the raw energy (think the Stooges “Raw Power” or the Velvets “Loaded”) that can only be transmitted before a band gets too big and get’s a big name producer to commercialize their message (yeah Guided by Voices, I’m looking at you during the “Do the Collapse” era).  So anyway, a band I stumbled across a few weeks back, the Athens, GA band, <a href=\"http://www.wevstheshark.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">We Versus the Shark</a>, provide a fantastic example of the DIY feel I love.  Their 2004 debut full length release <em>Ruin Everything!</em> is a very good and steady listen.  Anyone who knows me knows I love abrupt rhythm changes in my music, something about running full speed to drop back to a trot or crawl, and then to run again just makes it happen.  WVTS plays this to a T, with songs that start slow migrating in to true, riff-heavy, rockers.  Their sharp, angular rhythms have been compared to other favorite bands of mine from yore like Shellac and aMinurature by my wife, and I hear plenty of Babe The Blue Ox in there, although without the sweetness (which I prefer) along with the unpredictiblity of Brainiac.  I can’t think of another band, other than Indiana’s late Pencil, that the ‘<em>math rock</em>‘ label could be applied to so smoothly, so you should really check them out.

Between our home stereo to my car cd player to my iPod; I have plenty of outlets to plug into.  For all the things I dig, the old DIY ethic holds a precious place in my heart.  Sure, even though I'm open to hip-hop, americana, jazz, or whatever tag you need to put on things, there's something about the raw energy (think the Stooges \"Raw Power\" or the Velvets \"Loaded\") that can only be transmitted before a band gets too big and get's a big name producer to commercialize their message (yeah Guided by Voices, I'm looking at you during the \"Do the Collapse\" era).  So anyway, a band I stumbled across a few weeks back, the Athens, GA band, [We Versus the Shark](http://www.wevstheshark.com/), provide a fantastic example of the DIY feel I love.  Their 2004 debut full length release _Ruin Everything!_ is a very good and steady listen.  Anyone who knows me knows I love abrupt rhythm changes in my music, something about running full speed to drop back to a trot or crawl, and then to run again just makes it happen.  WVTS plays this to a T, with songs that start slow migrating in to true, riff-heavy, rockers.  Their sharp, angular rhythms have been compared to other favorite bands of mine from yore like Shellac and aMinurature by my wife, and I hear plenty of Babe The Blue Ox in there, although without the sweetness (which I prefer) along with the unpredictiblity of Brainiac.  I can't think of another band, other than Indiana's late Pencil, that the '_math rock_' label could be applied to so smoothly, so you should really check them out.
