![Ted Haggard Massage Table](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/table.jpg)Mike Jones, the former prostitute who Ted Haggard visited, has the offical [massage table on eBay](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&sspagename=ADME%3AB%3AAAQ%3AUS%3A1&viewitem=&item=290092184603&rd=1)!  It's currently at 1175$ with 6 days to go, and with "_All proceeds benefit 'Project Angel Heart', who provides people living with HIV/AIDS, cancer and other life-threatening illnesses nutritious home-delivered meals_" it's for the right reasons.  I took the opportunity to send him a note myself, "_Mike - Don't think your bravery wasn't noticed, thanks for doing what you did, and what you're doing now. We live in a free country, but when someone who judges others (especially when that person wields so much power) they need to be held accountable for their own actions.  Thanks_"  Regardless of your values and/or religious beliefs, I hope you feel the same about abuse of power and hypocrisy.

**UPDATE**: I heard back from Mike almost immeidately, "_Thank you for your kind words of support.  It means a lot to me.  The best to you.  Mike Jones_"    That makes me feel good, hopefully one day we'll be able to [treat everyone equally](http://hrc.org/) and not judge others.
