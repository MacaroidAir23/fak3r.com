This is an important video that I wish more would watch and think about the implications of the issues. One of the commentators is <a href="https://www.eff.org/about/staff/kurt-opsahl">Kurt Opsahl</a>, the first <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a> attorney I met and talked to at <a href="https://www.defcon.org/">DEF CON</a> many years ago, which set me on the path I've been on for years. You should be following him, <a href="https://twitter.com/kurtopsahl">@kurtopsahl</a>, on Twitter.
