![TJX](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/rtemagicc_tjx.jpg)Ah, nothing new, just another big corporation [leaking credit card and issuers personal data](http://www2.csoonline.com/blog_view.html?CID=28255).  "_The TJX Companies, a large retailer that operates more than 2,000 retail stores under brands such as Bobâ€™s Stores, HomeGoods, Marshalls, T.J. Maxx and A.J. Wright, said on Wednesday that it suffered a massive computer breach on a portion of its network that handles credit card, debit card, check and merchandise transactions in the United States and abroad. The company does not know the extent of the breach, which was **first discovered in December 2006. However, hackers may have made off with credit and debit information from transactions in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico in 2003 as well as transactions between May and December 2006**, according to a company statement. [...] In the end, the hack may affect a wide range of credit card companies and thousands of consumers in America and in countries like the United Kingdom and Ireland, experts say._"  I fail to understand  how this could have been happening since 2003 -- and then again for half of this past year!  We need more detail, but again, how could this go on for so long?  Why is this happening?  It's always the weakest link in the chain, but we need to know what it is so it can be plugged (so a new breach can appear later).  A losing battle?  Me thinks online payment and CC only transactions are only making things worse thanks to security that is bought by a company, instead of developed and understood in house. Seems like a good time to check back in with our friendly updated list, [A Chronology of Data Breaches](http://www.privacyrights.org/ar/ChronDataBreaches.htm), which has already been updated with this recent fun.
