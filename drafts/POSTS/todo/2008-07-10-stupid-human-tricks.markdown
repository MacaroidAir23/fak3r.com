[![](http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/question_dropshade.png)](http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/question_dropshade.png)Bored at work, well I'm not, but I did take a second to try this stupid thing, and it turns out it's kind of interesting.  Give it a shot, and remember, I never promised you all of my posts would be entertaining! ;)


> While sitting at your desk, raise your right foot off the floor and make clockwise circles.  Now, while doing this, draw the number "6" in the air with your right hand.  Your foot will change direction and there's nothing you can do about it.
