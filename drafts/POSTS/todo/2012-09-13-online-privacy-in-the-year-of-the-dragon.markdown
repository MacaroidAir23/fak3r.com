I was honored to be asked to speak at yesterday's [SecureWorld St. Louis](http://secureworldexpo.com/event/index.php/2012-saint-louis-home), my talk was titled_ Online Privacy in the Year of the Dragon_. My short abstract; "Businesses change online privacy policies to make user's data, and their interaction with websites, more profitable for the website's owners. Users need to understand what privacy is being lost, how their data is being used and how they can improve their online privacy with knowledge and open source software." See the slides below, and follow the link at the bottom to download as a PDF if you'd like. Thanks.
