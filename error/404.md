<h2>404</h2>

File not found

Don't you hate that? Well, after migrating from Wordpress there are going to be *some* URLs that are out there that are just not going to work anymore, I'm really sorry about that, but you can either go to the <a href="/">homepage</a> or do a <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=linux&q=site%3Afak3r.com">search</a> for what you're looking for. If you can't find it, <a href="/contact/">contact</a> me and we'll work it out. M'k?<br />Thanks
