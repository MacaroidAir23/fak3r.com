Amazing: designer Max Roberts re-created this 1980s subway map of divided Berlin from a museum postcard...

"Still a decade from reunification, the S-Bahn map shows a transit system filled with complicated politics. West Berlin S-Bahn lines were owned and operated by East Berlin, so West Berliners boycotted the GDR-owned service. Instead, they built their own roadway and U-Bahn line. That crippled the S-Bahn network financially, resulting in closed lines and a system that even today still struggles to keep up with demand. In a "last-ditch attempt to market a bankrupt network," Roberts hypothesizes, East Berlin created a map that highlighted its own lines in rainbow colors."
