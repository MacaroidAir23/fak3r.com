![Skype on Linux - FTW!](http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/logo-skype.jpg)This is a big deal for me, I played with [Skype](http://www.skype.com/welcomeback/) back in the day, but never really used it much since it required a second client, and I have always used Gaim (which is now [Pidgin](http://www.pidgin.im/)) to consolidate all of my accounts into one client and didn't want to break out of that mold, but now I don't have to.  Using the Skype API, Eion Robb has created a Pidgin plugin called [Skype API plugin for Pidgin/libpurple/Adium](http://myjobspace.co.nz/images/pidgin/).  Now I just add my user to the Pidgin accounts tab and I can now chat via Skype in Pidgin just like I chat with all my other contacts.  Note that you can't do the video of Skype on Pidgin.  Mac users note that you can use this on Adium (my fav OS X chat client), which uses libpurple, which is the backend for Pidgin, on Mac.  So now I'm using Skype again, which is a propreitary app, thanks to them providing an API for the Open Source community to latch on to.  Ah, the circle of life...
