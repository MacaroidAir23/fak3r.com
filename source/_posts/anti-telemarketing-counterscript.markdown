![telemarketer.gif](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/telemarketer.gif)"The Direct Marketing sector regards the telephone as one of its most successful tools. Consumers experience telemarketing from a completely different point of view: more than 92% perceive commercial telephone calls as a violation of privacy. Many business can avoid telemarketers with a blocking function on their [business phone system](http://phonebooth.com/). Telemarketers make use of a telescript - a guideline for a telephone conversation. This script creates an imbalance in the conversation between the marketer and the consumer. It is this imbalance, most of all, that makes telemarketing successful. The EGBG Counterscript attempts to redress that balance." Fantastic reference, [this page shows you the complete flowchart](http://www.xs4all.nl/~egbg/counterscript.html) to turn the tables on the telemarketers. Now all I have to do is get rude enough to run through this with one of them. Sometimes I just pretend I can't hear very well, other times I ask questions while they're talking, etc, but with all the blacklists and auto do-not-call lists, we don't get them anymore. The few we do we tell them that they're not allowed to call, and put us on the do-not-call list, they comply. Still, this is fun, would be nice to make it into a real script, one that would query known spam email servers with all sorts of junk without ever accepting the junk email!
