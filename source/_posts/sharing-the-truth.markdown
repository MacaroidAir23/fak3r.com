If you haven't seen An Inconvenient Truth, now you can get a copy on DVD for free.  Just [fill out your details on this site](http://sharethetruth.us/free/).  From their blurb, "_...__it is so grounded, so filled with integrity that even a lifelong republican who despised Al Gore in 2000 concludes that it's "simply great" (cite). And our generous donors will buy you the DVD. Oddly enough, this is probably the last movie on Earth that you need to be paid to see. There's no catch._"
