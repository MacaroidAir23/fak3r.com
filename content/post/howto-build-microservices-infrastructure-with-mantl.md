I've been a while since the [microservices-infructure](https://github.com/ciscocloud/microservices-infrastructure) started, and an impressive project designed to get a microservices infrastructure setup with a reasonable set of defaults and No they seem to be getting more serious about the project by renaming the project...

<div align="center"><img src="/2015/mantl-logo-1.png" border="0" alt="Mantl"></div>

[Mantl](http://mantl.io) describes itself as, "A container orchestrator, docker, a network stack, something to pool your logs, something to monitor health, a sprinkle of service discovery and some automation." This is all well and good, but just like my project stax, there's lots to do up front. Let's get it rolling on [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com), but note that it can also be run on Vagrant, Openstack, Google Compute Engine, as well as bare metal, via [Terraform](https://terraform.io/).

* assign that policy to the user

<<<<<<< HEAD
* setup security (provide new admin password when prompted)

./security-setup

* create SSH key

ssh-keygen -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -P ''

* install hosts with terraform

terraform get
terraform apply

* now look at the hosts with ansible

ansible all -i plugins/inventory/terraform.py -m ping

* if they answer 'pong' they’re all good

* configure it

cp terraform.sample.yml terraform.yml

* edit it (comment out consul_acl_datacenter: if you only have one datacenter)

vi terraform.yml

* run it with that file

ansible-playbook -i plugins/inventory/terraform.py -e @security.yml terraform.yml

(this will take some time)





# Conclusion

blah

=======
## Setup security in Mantl

* provide new admin password when prompted

```
./security-setup
```

* create SSH key

```
ssh-keygen -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -P ''
```

## Install hosts with terraform

```
terraform get
terraform apply
```

* now look at the hosts with ansible

```
ansible all -i plugins/inventory/terraform.py -m ping
```

* if they answer 'pong' they’re all good

## Configure the new instance definitions

```
cp terraform.sample.yml terraform.yml
```

* edit it (comment out consul_acl_datacenter: if you only have one datacenter)

```
vi terraform.yml
```

## Run ansible using the yml file

```
ansible-playbook -i plugins/inventory/terraform.py -e @security.yml terraform.yml
```

(this will take some time, usually ~30 minutes)

## Login to Marathon

* in a web browser, attach to the Marathon node, logging in with the creditials you entered above.

## Launch some docker instnaces on the cluster

# Conclusion

The Mantl project feels very
