![Morrissey](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/morrissey_18_wenn15999571.jpg)While he’s always been outspoken, one would hardly think of Morrissey as a [threat to America’s national security!](http://contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/morrissey%20quizzed%20by%20fbi_23_02_2006)  Well the FBI and British Intelligence disagreed, apparently. ”_Singer MORRISSEY was quizzed by the FBI and British intelligence after speaking out against the American and British governments.  The Brit is a famous critic of the US-led war in Iraq and has dubbed President GEORGE W BUSH a “terrorist” - but he was baffled to be hauled in by authorities. Morrissey explains, “The FBI and the Special Branch have investigated me and I’ve been interviewed and taped and so forth. “They were trying to determine if I was a threat to the government, and similarly in England. But it didn’t take them very long to realise that I’m not. “I don’t belong to any political groups, I don’t really say anything unless I’m asked directly and I don’t even demonstrate in public. I always assume that so-called authoritarian figures just assume that pop/rock music is slightly insane and an untouchable platform for the working classes to stand up and say something noticeable. “My view is that neither England or America are democratic societies. You can’t really speak your mind and if you do you’re investigated_.” As always, while Morrissey has stated how much he loves the United states (he’s lived in Los Angeles for over 10 years) he still has his problems with it, and doesn’t feel like he shouldn’t bring those up since this is a democracy.  I don’t expect to be the last we hear of this, Morrissey rarely backs down, alas a track from his forthcoming release contains the lyrics, ”_If your god bestows protection upon you / And if the USA doesn’t bomb you / I believe I will see you Somewhere safe_”
