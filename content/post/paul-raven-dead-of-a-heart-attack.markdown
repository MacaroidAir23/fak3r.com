![Paul Raven](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/paul_raven.PNG)Wow, here's an unexpected blast from the past, Paul Raven, bass player for industrial bands that I used to love like Pigface and Murder, Inc., as well as Killing Joke and Ministry contributer, has [died in his sleep of a heart attack](http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=83199) in France at the age of 46.  "_MINISTRY bassist Paul Raven was found dead yesterday (Saturday, October 20) in a private home in a small French village on the Swiss border after suffering an apparent heart attack. Raven (who is also known for his work with KILLING JOKE and PRONG) was in Geneva working with French recording artists TREPONEM PAL on their new release alongside drummer Ted Parsons (PRONG) and members of THE YOUNG GODS. Born in Wolverhampton, UK on January 16, 1961, Paul Vincent Raven established himself with his work in the seminal post-punk/industrial act KILLING JOKE after he replaced the band's original bassist in 1982, recording and touring with the group throughout its most commercially successful period, performing on "Fire Dances", "Night Time" and "Brighter than a Thousand Suns". Throughout his extensive career, Raven participated in other collaborations, including PRONG, MURDER, INC., PIGFACE and GODFLESH. Most recently, Raven was nominated for a 2006 Grammy for "Best Metal Performance" for his work with MINISTRY's Al Jourgensen, with whom he had begun collaborating in late 2005 on the MINISTRY release "Rio Grande Blood". After a 2006 world tour with the group, Raven helped Jourgensen and PRONG's Tommy Victor pen the latest MINISTRY CD, "The Last Sucker", which is also the band's final studio release_."  While much of the industrial music I dug years ago (listed above, and bands like Skinny Puppy, Nitzer Ebb, Revolting Cocks and the like) haven't stood the test of time, I need to break out the [_Murder, Inc._](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder%2C_Inc._%28band%29) CD and give it another go.  The combination of rhythm with Chris Connelly's vocals made it a classic industrial record, with Paul Raven and the then current incarnation of Killing Joke.
