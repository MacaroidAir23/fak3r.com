On our website we write, “Being better is more important than being the “best”, because “best” means complacency and better means progress. We are always improving. Improvement requires reflection, so we take ownership of our mistakes and question our habits.”  This value takes on slightly different shades of meaning for the everyone here at Clef.  It’s about cultivating a positive culture of learning, improvement, and trust generally but when asked to explain how each team member embodies this value new ways of understanding emerge.
