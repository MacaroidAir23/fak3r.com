![Spam](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/spam.gif)This is an amazing statistic, particularly after knowing how much email was just spam as of last month, the [level of spam is down 30% from last week](http://www.shortnews.com/shownews.cfm?id=59491).  "_After rising steadily for many years spam levels have mysteriously dropped 30% in the first week of January. According to SoftScan the most plausible explanation is that a botnet has broken down and lost control of it's zombie computers. 	  	 Other possible explanations have been put forward including a large number of infected machines getting replaced by new computers received for Christmas or spammers being isolated by the Asian earthquake. Both explanations are considered unlikely. 	  	 Spam accounted for almost 9 of 10 emails in December. Diego d'Ambra, SoftScan's chief technology officer, said that governments will probably be forced to take a tougher stance on spam due to the sheer volume of the problem._"  That would be amazing if they could tie it to people getting new computers over the holidays and finally shutting down their trojan based messes.  Of course it'll just be a matter of time until their systems get back to that state and they start complaining their computers are 'slow' (wonder why?).Â  I'm sure buying a new computer next year will solve that.
