!()[2015/android_full_control.png]


since I have a nexus 5, I'm almost unlimited in what I can do. I've
unlocked the bootloader, wiped the phone, installed a fully open-sourced
version of Android, went in and disabled all the default apps I don't
want running (email and browser for example since I use a diff email and
I want Firefox instead of Chrome), plus have not installed *any* google
stuff, and have connected it to SMS, Fastmail (which contains email,
calendar, contacts, etc) and services that I want to use, knowing none
of them have permission to track me (using a tool for that, which
defaults to 'ask') with the exception of Waze, which I allow to track me
when I have it on for navigation. Meanwhile I have a shell on the phone
(which I need since if I can't SSH into it, I don't own it) and the
'wallpaper' on the phone keeps me in the loop, as I need to be.
