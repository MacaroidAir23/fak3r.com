I take digital rights and online privacy very seriously, which I cover on a more regular basis on my site covering such issues, [Left to chance](http://lefttochance.com). Because of this I've always felt conflicted in posting ads on my sites, and in fact, for the 5 years I've had this site, it's only been the last year that I've had ads on it. While the idea that "everyone else is doing it" isn't the best reason for trying things out, I'll admit it is nice to get a 100$ check from Google every other month or so. No, it's not going to help me build that super computer in my basement, but it defers some of my home DSL bill that I run my servers on. So, since I use different ad services here on [fak3r.com](http://fak3r.com), it's important to be as open and transparent in explaining what that means for visitors to the site. Here's what you need to know:


> Fak3r.com uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about **not** having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

Also, Google now uses the [DoubleClick DART cookie](http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx) in the ads served on fak3r.com (and most other websites displaying AdSense for content ads). When users visit an AdSense publisher's website and either view or click on an ad, a cookie may be dropped on that end user's browser. The data gathered from these cookies will be used to help AdSense publishers better serve and manage the ads on their site(s) and across the web.

Because of this **you need to know the following** information about Google and the [DoubleClick DART cookie](http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx):

> 
> 
	
>   * Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on this site.
> 
	
>   * Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet.
> 
	
>   * **Users may opt out** of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

So, I'll try this for a bit, we'll see if it truly gives more targets ads to users or not. While I'd like to make more money off of this site, I don't want to via any sleazy means that make people feel ripped off; there's enough of that to go around on the Internet. This is my personal blog, and I don't pretend it's the next Digg or Huffington Post, so I don't expect anyone to put up with anything more than the occasional banner ad on my site. Having said that, if you want to opt out of using the DART Cookie, please do, and then help others understand their rights and options online, since this is what I think is still sorely lacking in today's general Internet user. In fact, there are plenty of add-ons for Firefox that will help you get rid of seeing any ads online, period, so know that that's another option that you have. Additionally, if you hate the idea of the new cookies and want to comment directly to me about it, drop a line to me at fak3r at fak3r dot com

Thanks
