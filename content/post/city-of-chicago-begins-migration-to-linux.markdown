"Red Hat [has announced that the city of Chicago has started migrating to the](http://www.principal.com/marketnews/news_template.htm?story=20061023/296b1875.xml&ns=STKP) Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system. The city has already saved $250,000 from switching to Linux, according to Red Hat. Systems required for vehicle registration, restaurant inspections, online job applications, ethics training and other systems will have Red Hat installed._   "For the City of Chicago, information technology (IT) is an integral part of the government’s processes and services to the city’s nearly 3 million residents. City officials, led by Mayor Richard M. Daley, have embraced a Transparent Government initiative and are committed to running an open, responsive and fiscally responsible government."_  City Stickers, the motor vehicle department for Chicago, is the first program that has switched to Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  The site is responsible for managing and tracking all vehicle permits and provide an online service which allows Chicago residents to purchase and renew tags and stickers.   Governments and school districts have been making the switch to open source technology to help reduce costs.   [Munich announced last month that it is beginning “Limux,”](http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=4286) a “Linux in Munich” initiative.  Munich hopes to have four out of every five PCs switched to open source technology by the end of 2008."
