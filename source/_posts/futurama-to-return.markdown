[![](http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/futurama_pose_billy_west.jpg)](http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/futurama_pose_billy_west.jpg)In what would be a cool trend, Futurama could [come back from the dead](http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/off-the-planet/2005/12/10/1134086846734.html), ala Family guy.  ”_Nearly four years after it was cancelled, the popularity of Futurama on DVD could breathe life back into the animated television series. On the subject of a rumoured resurrection, creator Matt Groening, best known for his other animated hit, The Simpsons, says, intriguingly, “You never know.” Such a trail was blazed in 2004 by another animated series, Family Guy. Fuelled by DVD sales and high-rating reruns, it spawned a direct-to-DVD film and two seasons of television episodes_.”  It would be nice to see shows being on television because people were given a chance to like them, and vote with their dollars.  Ahem…the apply named [Arrested Development](http://www.fox.com/arresteddev/) anyone?
