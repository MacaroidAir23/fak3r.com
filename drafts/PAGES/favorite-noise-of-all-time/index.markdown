﻿(aka **Songs to learn and sing**)

Ok, so instead of presenting what music I like now, or my favorite releases from the previous years (which you can see back to 2001 [here](http://fak3r.com/noise/)) I'm going to list what I believe to be the greatest recorded works ever released. Feel free to disagree and/or complain, but I hope you discover some new favorites. (**note**: this list may be updated or appended at any time to correct inaccuracies, errors or changes in taste or temperature, so please, no wagering on outcomes. I cannot be responsible for any loss of property incurred while reading this list, so if in doubt, ask your doctor if fak3r.com is right for you)
