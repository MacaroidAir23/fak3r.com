![royksopp](http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/royksopp-150x150.jpg)I have an older [Röyksopp](http://www.royksopp.com) cd, and Norwegian duo has everything you could want in an electronic outfit; driving beats, unobtrusive synthesized vocals topped by happy melodies to rule them.  Of course if the video features a Space Invaders theme, it's going to immediately get my attention, plus I love the idea of advertising attacking us, so here we are.  Am I that transparent?  Na, I think I just like some escapism from indie rock every now and then and this kind of pop is the vessel.  Looks like I have my next target to buy, and I will now surf around for the perfect Space Invader tattoo; it's out there somewhere ([uh](http://www.bytecellar.com/archives/000105.php), [yeah](http://www.flickr.com/photos/57565415@N00/121394297/))
