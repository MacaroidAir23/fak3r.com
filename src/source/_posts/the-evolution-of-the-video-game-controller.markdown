![2600 joystick](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/2600_joystick.jpg)Like a walk down memory lane, you'll never forget your first...video game controller that is.  That's mine on the right, yeah, she got around a bit, but hey.  So anyway, here's a great site with an overview of the evolution of the [video game controller](http://blog.hahauk.com/2007/01/evolution-of-controller.html), all the way back to the Magnavox Odyssey.  Wow, I've owned 8 of those systems!  Atari 2600, Colecovision, NES, Sega Genesis, SNES, Sony Playstation, Gamecube and now the Wii.  Yeah, the only Nintendo I didn't own was the N64, which supposedly rocked.  Then if you really want to get into it, there's a fantastic 'family tree' version with even more (all?) of the controllers; [Sock Master's Game Console Controller Family Tree](http://www.axess.com/twilight/console/)!  Much more in depth, with details once you click on them.  Far out, fun to see how Nintendo lead so much of the way, but also to see how the Xbox followed Saturn's lead.  Damn, and I played the Atari Jaguar at a party ("avoid the ground!") and that controller bit, hard.  But check out 'The Nintendo Game & Watch', a Donkey Kong game from 1982; the case is a dead ringer for the Nintendo DS!  Damn, this is fun stuff.
