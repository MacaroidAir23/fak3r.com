![Bob Mould](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/bob-mould-press-photo.jpg)And you were bummed when you lost your last years worth of email?  Checkout [this post](http://modulate.blogspot.com/) from Bob Mould (Husker Du, Sugar, Bob Mould Band) on January 29: "_Today, I'm off to see the data recovery people. My main external drive failed yesterday afternoon; yes, all the files for the new album are on the drive. It started making a clicking sound before crashing, so it could be any of a number of problems. I'm quite concerned, but all I can do is stay hopeful that the data can be retrieved. This is the second major setback in the past 5 months of working on the album._"  Come on Bob, someone you know has to know how to backup harddrives...if you're in a pinch shoot me an email and I'll help you out (and perhaps upload a smoking [Husker Du boot from 85](http://www.upto11.net/albumprofile.php?al=104345)!)
