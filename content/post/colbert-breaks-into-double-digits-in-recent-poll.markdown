![Stephen Colbert](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/colbert.jpg)Apparently Stephen Colbert's "candidacy" has started to take off, apparently a new poll (in South Carolina only natch) [shows him in double digits](http://blogs.reuters.com/trail08/2007/10/24/take-that-nader-colbert-breaks-into-double-digits/)! "_Comedian Stephen Colbert, who recently announced he would run for U.S. president as both a Democrat and a Republican but only in the state of South Carolina, scored 13 percent in a new poll conducted by Rasmussen Reports. The national telephone survey found that 13 percent chose Colbert as an independent candidate in a race against Democratic Sen. Hillary Clinton and former New York mayor Republican Rudy Giuliani. Colbert received 12 percent support when former Sen. Fred Thompson was suggested as the Republican candidate. (Clinton won both match-ups in the poll.) The host of “The Colbert Report” on Comedy Central declared his newfound political intentions last week and clarified his position a few days later, telling NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday: “I don’t want to be president. I want to run for president. There’s a difference._”
