![powned.](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/pawnedjpegsmall.jpg)I reported on this [earlier](http://fak3r.com/2007/01/19/tjx-companies-data-breach-reveals-credit-card-data/), but only now are we learning the [scope of the breach](http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2007/03/tjx_breach_invo.html).  "_At least **45.7 million credit and debit card numbers were stolen** by __hackers who broke into the computer systems at the [TJX Cos.](http://boston.stockgroup.com/sn_overview.asp?ticker=TJX) in Framingham and the United Kingdom and siphoned off data over a period of several years, making it the **biggest breach of personal data ever reported**, according to security specialists. TJX, the Framingham discounter that operates the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls clothing chains, also reported in a regulatory filing yesterday that another 455,000 customers who returned merchandise without receipts had their __personal data stolen, including drivers’ license numbers. ‘‘It’s the biggest card heist ever,’’ said _![Information Security pain points…](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/is_pain_points.gif)_Avivah Litan, vice president of Gartner Inc. ‘‘This was obviously done over a long period of time, in many locations. It’s done considerable__ damage.’’_" There's been news that the cards [have been used for months](http://money.cnn.com/2007/01/25/news/companies/tjx/?postversion=2007012514) now, and now [Consumerist ](http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/tjmaxx/how-tjmaxx-hackers-stole-457-million-credit-cards-248570.php)covers the ongoing *how did this happen* question. "_TJMaxx computer system intruders who stole 45.7 million credit cards. **The **__**worm operated **__**undetected for at least 18 months**, capturing credit card numbers, then __changing timelogs and moving data around to erase its tracks. Initial speculation suggested that the thieves had access to the retailer's encryption __key. Now **it may be that the program captured data before it was encrypted. If the latter**, the ramifications are immense, as** it means every single retailer's credit card processing system is at risk**._"
