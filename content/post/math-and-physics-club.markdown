![Math and Physics Club](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/mapc.jpg)Much like The Lucksmiths, The Isles and Voxtrot, Seatle's [Math and Physics Club](http://mathandphysicsclub.com) put forth a Smiths rendered pallet as seen through a Belle and Sebastian filter, and it sounds nice.  I think [Pitchfork summed it up](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/39812/Math_and_Physics_Club_Math_and_Physics_Club), without as much name dropping, really well; "_The Seattle quintet's self-titled album should get some warm looks from a new generation of tender-hearted, bookish music listeners. Following a pair of solid (if by-the-book) 2005 EPs, Weekends Away and Movie Ending Romance, MAPC's full-length debut dusts off another 10 brazenly sweet songs of quiet heartbreak, late-summer acoustic guitar, reverb-laden Rickenbacker, tambourine, and occasional violin. "We've been down this road before," bespectacled singer/guitarist Charles Bert croons softly on "You'll Miss Me", and it won't take twee kids long to play spot-the-influences. But, in the words of distinguished Australian forebears (and labelmates) the Lucksmiths: "Once more won't hurt/ So let's do it once more._"  So RIYL the above mentioned bands, or if you want a break from all things loud, check this out.
