![grn_tea.jpg](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/grn_tea.jpg)Back when I was in Austin, I worked with a girl from China, her accent was very hard to understand, and her database administration was a bit heavy handed, but for the most part she knew what she was doing.  Also, she would drink green tea practically all the time.  Knowing it was good for you, I and another chap started the practice, which I've carried on (off and on that is) until present day.  Now in a desk drawer I have a box of green tea, and make hot or cold cups during the day, depending on the temperature and my mood.  Seems like I may want to up my consumption, and it'll be easy since I drink so much water during the day, I'll just chuck in a bag and sip away.  So even though it's been known to be healthy, now it's even more so according to ![dr_grn_tea.jpg](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/dr_grn_tea.jpg)a new study reported in the September 13th Journal of the American Medical Association: [drinking green tea lower's risk of death due to cardiovascular disease](http://www.ivanhoe.com/channels/p_channelstory.cfm?storyid=14488) *and* another study that claims [it may curb prostate cancer in men at risk](http://paktribune.com/news/index.shtml?153783). "_Adults in Japan who consumed five or more cups of green tea a day had a __lower risk of death due to cardiovascular disease, __according to a new study. Researchers from Japan examined the association between green tea consumption and death due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and the overall death rate within a large population. Eighty percent of the population in this region drinks green tea, and more than half consume three or more cups a day. The study included 40,350 adults in northeastern Japan between 40 and 70 years of age. None of them had any history of __stroke, coronary heart disease, or cancer at the beginning of the study. The participants in this study were followed for 11 years, from 1995 to 2006. During the 11 years in which the study took place, 4,209 participants died. More than 800 of the participants died of cardiovascular disease, and 1,134 died of cancer. Researchers then compared participants who drank less than one cup of green_![grn_tea_field.jpg](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/grn_tea_field.jpg)_ tea a day to those who drank at least five cups a day. Participants who consumed five or __more cups a day had 16-percent lower risk of CVD-related death. The association between green tea consumption and lower risk of CVD was higher among women. Of just the female participants, those who consumed five or more cups a day had a 31-percent lower risk of CVD-related death compared to those who drank less than one cup a day.  "Green tea may prolong your life through reducing heart disease and stroke," Kuriyama tells WebMD. "Our findings might explain the differences in mortality profile __between Japan and the United States. The Japanese age-adjusted rate of mortality due to [heart disease and stroke] is about 30 percent lower than that of the United States."_"  You can find the offical JAMA report [here](http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/296/10/1255?lookupType=volpage&vol=296&fp=1255&view=short).

Meanwhile, Dr. Saverio Bettuzzi from the University of Parma in Italy reveals [his study](http://paktribune.com/news/index.shtml?153783) that showed that, "_after a year, only 1 man among 32 in the GTC (green tea catechins) group developed prostate cancer, a rate of only 3 percent. In contrast, 9 out of 30 men treated with placebo developed prostate cancer, for the expected rate of 30 percent. The investigator performed a trial involving men with high-grade PIN, who were given an inactive placebo preparation or one containing 600 milligrams of GTCs daily, "equivalent to 12-15 cups of green tea infusion, that is about two times the average intake in Asian countries." "To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that GTCs have potent in vivo chemoprevention activity for human prostate cancer," Bettuzzi noted. "There are other studies strongly suggesting that similar results could be obtained for prevention of other types of cancer. As a matter of fact, breast and colon cancer are possible targets. In the near future, we are supposed to start a collaborative trial involving both Italy and USA on this matter," Bettuzzi concluded._"  And yes, I've already drank 2 cups of green tea this morning!
