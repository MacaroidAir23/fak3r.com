Someone has taken time collecting pictures of [Anthropomorphic Cannibalism at Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/agmilmoe/sets/72157594356771968/), which is essentially ads for food, showing the subject of the food, eating itself.  Really funny when you think about it, but it took this pool of pics to really make me see it.

Pretty cool, but anytime you look at ads too closely you'll find disturbing things - I really long for a place without the constant distractions of ads thrown in your face, and no, me having ads on my site does not play into that...
