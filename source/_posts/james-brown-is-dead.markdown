![James Brown](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/jb3.jpg)While it's old news now, legendary soul singer James Brown passed away early in the morning on Christmas Day in Atlanta. He was 73.  I found it funny that there was an article out yesterday stating that James Brown [may ultimately have been more influential than Elvis](http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/entertainment/music/16365942.htm).  Uh, *may have been*?  WTF, think about which artist brought his own sound, his own moves, his own songs to the people, and then re-ask that question.  His 103 singles on the R&B charts can speak for themselves as well.   Pitchfork has an [awesome writeup of his life](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/40233/James_Brown_19332006), including many early details that would shape his life.  The self-proclaimed Hardest Working Man in Show Business kept to it, as days before his death he was handing out toys for charity, with a New Year's Eve concert scheduled.  Speaking of bringing it to the people, here's a rather comical but informative [write-up about viewing Brown's body](http://www.prefixmag.com/blog/prefix/2006/12/29/james-browns-viewing-at-the-apollo/) as it laid in repose at Harlem's legendary Apollo and the ensuing environment that surrounded it.  For now it's time to slap 1963's LP _[Live at the Apollo](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001FWQ/$%7B0%7D)_ on the iPod for a reminder of his greatness.  For more complete coverage, _[Star Time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Time)_ is in order.  James Brown, rest in peace (and make it funky).
