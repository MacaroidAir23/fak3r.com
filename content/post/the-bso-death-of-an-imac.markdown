![BSOD iMac](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/bsodimac.jpg)Not much to say on this, one, so [here’s the article](http://www.tuaw.com/2006/04/05/blue-screen-of-death-on-an-imac/).  ”_Well, that didn’t take long. It seems that Windows’ crash-tastic tendencies aren’t limited to PCs. Check out [this post](http://www.dealcatcher.com/forums/m_402248/tm.htm) by Deal Catcher forum user dbaxter. He writes that after installing Boot Camp, things were going swimmingly…for thirty minutes. While browsing USB devices, Windows did what Windows does best. Nothing. Since this is the first we’ve seen the BSOD as generated by Windows on an Mactel following a Boot Camp install, it would seem that dbaxter has produced the 1st “official” BSOD on an Mac. What an honor_.”  Here's a [full sized image](http://images.dealcatcher.com/products/1stbluescreen.jpg), or a parody [video](http://youtube.com/watch?v=RwHMIxdDdu8).
