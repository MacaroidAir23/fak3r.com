![Tux on a Visa](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/card.jpg)Classic, nice to have this back as an option; you can now get Tux on a Visa card from [linuxfund.org](http://www.linuxfund.org/).  If I wasn't completely enamored with my 'Working Assets' card I'd grab one of these.  Who knows, maybe sometime down the road I'll get one, it's for great causes of course, "_Each time a cardholder uses their card, a donation is made to The Linux Fund by the card issuer, U.S. Bank. These donations add up to tens of thousands of dollars per year which The Linux Fund then gives out in grants. The Linux Fund has donated to new ideas and teams who maintain things like Debian_".  Would be really funny to see [Puffy](http://marcoalfonso.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/puffy.gif) from OpenBSD on a credit card...but I'm not sure if I'd want to use that one!
