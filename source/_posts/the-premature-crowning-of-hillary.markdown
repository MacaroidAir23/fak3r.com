![Hillary beats Obama?](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/20071031_dn_0jqr5btl_0.jpg)Hillary is being crowned the 'come from behind kid' after 'winning' the New Hampshire primary; but this appears to be nothing but spin.  First of all the results, Hillary took 39% of the popular vote to Barack 's 37%, so Hillary wins, right?  Not exactly, if you look at the delegate count you'll see a different picture.  Remember, people can win the popular vote and loose the election (Gore).  From the article/discussion on [CNN's Political Ticker](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/01/09/final-the-new-hampshire-delegate-breakdown/) you'll see the results:<!-- more -->


> In the New Hampshire Democratic primary

CNN estimates:

* Hillary Clinton has **won 9 New Hampshire delegates (3 statewide, 6 district-level)**

* Barack Obama has won **9 New Hampshire delegates (3 statewide, 6 district-level)**

* John Edwards has won 4 New Hampshire delegates (2 statewide, 2 district-level)

* 22 Democratic delegates were at stake in the New Hampshire primary


Ok, so it was a tie in regards to the delegates, but Hillary won the popular vote, but wait, what about the 'superdelegates' in New Hampshire?  Back to the article:


> * There are also **8 Democratic “superdelegates” in New Hampshire. Of those, 2 support Clinton and 3 support Obama**, according to a CNN survey.


So now it looks like Obama was actually the winner, making the 'win' for Hillary seems like an old fashioned PR/spinfest.  Even though they're first, Iowa and New Hampshire are small states, and in the end, 2,025 delegates are needed to secure the nomination.  The fact that people seem to be winning and losing at this stage is irresponsible. Ok, so now Obama has won 2 states, but wait, what about the super delegates in Iowa?
