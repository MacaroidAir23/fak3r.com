[![](http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/120px-gay_flagsvg.png)](http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/120px-gay_flagsvg.png)The fact that [Proposition 8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_8_(2008)) passed this last week in Califonia is a sad commentary on people's morays and the discrimination that they still think is ok to pass on to others.  Of course the statistic that African Americans (whose strong turnout is being attributed to Obama) voting 2 to 1 *for* the measure is particularly ironic.  The best commentary I've heard on this issue comes from [Keith Olbermann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Olbermann), who says all I'd like to, and more.  While it's small solace, we  just have to remember that this kind of racism is dying off.
