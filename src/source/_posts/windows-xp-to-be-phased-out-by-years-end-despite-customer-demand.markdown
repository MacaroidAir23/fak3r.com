![Windows XP Scream](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/windows-xp-screambody-thumbnail.png)Microsoft is set to [phase out Windows XP by the end of this year](http://apcmag.com/5835/vendors_in_no_rush_to_ditch_xp_for_vista), even though the majority of businesses have no reason or desire to update to Vista, since most of those updates would require new hardware.   It's just another example of Microsoft not listening to their customers, just to their shareholders.  "_Computer makers have been told they'll no longer be able to get Windows XP OEM by the end of this year, despite consumer resistance to Vista and its compatibility problems. B__y early 2008, Microsoft's contracts with computer makers will require companies to only sell Vista-loaded machines. "The OEM version of XP Professional goes next January," said Frank Luburic, senior ThinkPad product manager for Lenovo. "At that point, they'll have no choice._"  Sure, I can throw in my "let's hope for a major Linux migration", but I won't.  It won't happen on the scale it should, but still, some companies are going to start waking up; it has to happen.  Hell, if I have to get a job at some small company where I'm tasked with supporting a network of Linux workstations and servers, I'll do it.  It can be done, companies will save money; it's just a matter of  hiring a competent employee that really knows his stuff.
