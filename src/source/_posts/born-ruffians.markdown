![Born Ruffians](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/born_ruf.jpg)Today I heard a track from [Born Ruffians](http://www.bornruffians.com/) (a band I hadn't even heard of before) debut EP, and it's pretty nice, making [I (heart) music](http://www.iheartmusic.net/)'s top EP of the year.  Pitchfork sums them up with; "_Born Ruffians are three Toronto teenagers with the precise sound we imagine when we think of indie rock in this post-Arcade Fire, post-CYHSY world. Of course, originality doesn't matter much as long as the band gets the details right, as BR do. They've got some things going for them: a few of these songs are tremendously catchy; they're funny and don't appear to take themselves seriously..._"  Wow, more great tunes from Canada!
