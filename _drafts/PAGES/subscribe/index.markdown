While **fak3r** is updated on an almost daily basis, it's not expected that you would want to visit every day, or several times a day, to see if there are any updates. Nowadays people 'subscribe' to feeds or use another method so that the site can send out the updates, making it easier to stay up to date. Currently you can subscribe to fak3r via **RSS**, **Technorati** or **email**.  Here are the specifics for each.

**Grab the RSS Feed**
RSS is an easy, free way to keep track of sites that update frequently. Lots of people who read blogs use an RSS reader like Bloglines, Yahoo, Google, etc. It makes it much easier to read your favorite sites, since the reader will tell you when those sites are updated. I personally use/like Google Reader, I think it's the best of the bunch for now.  If you signup for a free account on one of these sites you can add fak3r's RSS feed to it.

_ So how do you grab the RSS feed?_

It all starts with the orange icon you see in the top right-hand corner of the Subscribe panel (or just below). That's become a universal icon to let you know that the site has an RSS feed. Just click the icon and you'll be brought to a page of your feed reader (or otherwise prompted by your browser) that helps with the final steps of subscribing. Or you could just right-click the icon, save the URL to the feed and paste it into your existing feed reader. To get started click the RSS icon below.

** Subscribe via Technorati**
You can add fak3r to your Technorati Favorites, this way whenever a new article is posted, the list is updated. With Technorati you can add multiple blogs to your favorites and track them all together and you can unsubscribe anytime. It's a good, free service that has it's own community around it.  Once signed up for an account you would just click on the following to add fak3r to your watchlist.

** Subscribe via email**
You can receive free, daily email updates to your inbox from fak3r.  Note, you'll only receive an email that day if fak3r has new content. It's easy to sign up for, just put your email address in the box, and you will get emails delivered by Feedburner.
