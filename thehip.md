Obviously music, and bands, mean a lot to me, so to see, hear, experience their entire story of 30 years is a big deal. This is The Tragically Hip, I always tell the story of discovering them in 1987, the same year I was learning about The Cure, New Order and The Smiths, which the Hip had nothing in common. Their style was still in a blues rock/bar band, but they were great. They grew as their singer Gord's songwriting did, and their live shows were always a blast. The band was great and genuine, but Gord was just a character to see as he almost acted out his songs. They never left their Canadian heritage and became heroes there. They played their last show last night, in Kingston where they got their start. Gord, who is 52, has an inoperable brain tumor and he's not expected to make it through the year, so this summer was their last hurrah. Really good write-up in Slate, focusing a lot on what the band meant to the country, but a unique, sweet story in its own right.

It was another Canadian rock icon, Neil Young, who articulated one of rock and roll’s supposed principles: “It’s better to burn out than to fade away.” Gord Downie is living that, but not by way of narcissistic self-destruction. He is burning out by working, and making art. He is achieving a beautiful death.
