![Sleater-Kinney](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/sleaterkinney2.jpg)Sleater-Kinney is breaking up, or going on 'indefinite hiatus', but either way, this is disappointing news, especically since their last release, _The Woods_, was their first on [big label](http://www.subpop.com/), and [so well recieved by critics](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/21791/SleaterKinney_The_Woods) (not to mention making my '[Best of 2005](http://fak3r.com/?p=53)' list).  The posting on their site tells it all, "_After eleven years as a band, [Sleater-Kinney](http://www.sleater-kinney.com/) have decided to go on indefinite hiatus. The upcoming summer shows will be our last. As of now, there are no plans for future tours or recordings. We feel lucky to have had the support of many wonderful people over the years. We want to thank everyone who has worked with us, written kind words about us, performed with us, and inspired us. But mostly we want to extend our gratitude to our amazing fans. You have been a part of our story from the beginning. We could not have made our music without your enthusiasm, passion, and loyalty. It is you who have made the entire journey worthwhile_.  With love and thanks, Sleater-Kinney"  Rats.  Oh well, makes me all the happier that I [saw them in Saint Louis last year](http://fak3r.com/?p=78), they put on a heck of a show too.  Here's hoping for the best for each of them, they took a long road and accomplished what most bands only dream of.
