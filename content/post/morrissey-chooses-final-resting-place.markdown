![Morrissey](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/060404_morrissey.jpg)While certainly putting the cart before the horse, Morrissey has [chosen where he wants to be buried](http://www.spin.com/features/news/2007/02/070208_morrissey/); Los Angeles celebrity cemetery [Hollywood Forever](http://www.hollywoodforever.com/), right next to Johnny Ramone.  "_I like that cemetery. I stumbled across [Johnny Ramone's stone](http://www.seeing-stars.com/ImagePages/JohnnyRamoneGravePhoto.shtml) and thought it was very nicely placed_," he told The Daily Express. "_I sat there for a long time and I felt quite good about it. It was nice his bones were under the soil I was sitting on. So yeah, that's my spot_."  He says he doesn't want a big memorial, as neighbor Johnny has, "_I want nothing other than name, birth date, death date_", and then leaves a perfect quote for my Morrissey collection "_Death is a serious thing, certainly not to be sneezed at._"
