![The New Pornographers live](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/np300x225.jpg)Damn, it seems that NPR has a continuous thing for Nico Neco (uggg, I still spell her name wrong), I mean Neko Case, as they have gone out of their way to [showcase her most recent album](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5306138), _Fox Confessor Brings the Flood_, Her continued recording and [touring work with The New Pornographers](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15333436) and now even boasts a full concert of her playing the Disney Hall in LA from November 16th (props to scooter b for the original tip).  Hosted by Alex Cohen, the show is a available on NRP's music site for [download or podcast](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16220628).  While The New Pornographers style is straight up, fun, power-pop, Neko's solo work is steeped more in bittersweet country and gospel, however she seems to combine both on her solo shows, which I have not experienced in person.  Her prior release to 'Flood', was the strong live effort, The Tigers Have Spoken.  TNP are a different story, I've seen them twice and they're even more fun in person than they releases hint at; highly recommended.  Give her a listen.
