![Refused Live](http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/refused_1.jpg)Swedish band [Refused](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refused) is my all time favorite hardcore band, which ended after the release and abbreviated tour of their last album, the monumental, **_The Shape of Punk to Come_** - a CD permanently on the list of my all time fav records.  Word from the [Refusedfan.com](http://www.refusedfan.com/news2008.html) website is that Refused member David Sandström has dropped that a live cd will finally see the light of day this year.  "_This year will most likely give us a new REFUSED record! It's their US label Epitaph that are planning to release a live album! The band had a meeting sometime ago regarding this and regarding their contract with Epitaph.   David Sandström says:   "...It was nice to meet again but it feels kind of surrealistic that new material will see the light _![The Shape of Punk to Come](http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/refused-shape_of_punk-reiss.jpg)_of day when we quit the band almost 10 years ago..."  This is really great news and I will keep you updated about it as soon as I hear anything!   Check this [link](www.folkbladet.nu/2008/01/30/refused-slapper-nytt-album) for more info (only in Swedish):   Another thing to look forward to is the upcoming DAVID SANDSTRÖM __OVERDRIVE album. There will probably be a single released in February and the album will probably be out in March!_" For anyone who has any sort of appreciation for hardcore, pick-up the aforementioned _TSOPTC_, or the earlier (and perhaps more representational of hardcore from a straightedge view) _Songs to Fan the Flames of Discontent_, for primer; this is an important band, even 10 years after their demise.<!-- more -->
