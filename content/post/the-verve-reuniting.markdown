![The Verve](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/verve.jpg)Of all the brit pop bands to have gone away, The Verve were a great one, and [a fitting one to reunite](http://www.theverve.tv/). "_Silent since 1999, U.K. rock act the Verve is reuniting for a new album and fall live dates.  According to a post on the group's [newly launched Web site](http://www.theverve.tv/), Richard Ashcroft, Nick McCabe, Simon Jones and Pete Salisbury were in a London studio last week laying down tracks for the album, which will be completed in the fall.  [...] It appears guitarist/keyboardist Simon Tong, who was last heard from in the Good, the Bad and the Queen, is sitting out the reunion._"  I have all of their cds, but the only time I saw them live was a tour for their first cd, back in '94.  At the time I think some in the band were only 19...great, great set though.  That first cd takes me back to working in the art gallery, at a time where I was drinking too much (coffee and beer) while making no money, but having the time of my life seeing bands.
