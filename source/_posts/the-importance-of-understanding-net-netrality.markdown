To understand how importance net neutrality is you need to watch the following video.  Think about the freedom that the Internet allows you, now think about how you are limited to certain 'packages' when you pay for cable or satellite access to watch TV.  This is exactly how the corporate behemoths want to make your choices for the Internet.  It makes sense, they're not stupid, they see the opportunity to make money, and making your freedom into the proverbial carrot and stick makes perfect sense...for them.





Their title for the video is _2012: The Year The Internet Ends_.  Learn more, and how you can spread the word, at [I Power](http://ipower.ning.com/netneutrality).  Thanks.
