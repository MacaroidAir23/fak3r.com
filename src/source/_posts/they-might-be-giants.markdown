![They Might Be Giants](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/200px-theymightbegiants-theymightbegiants.jpg)Last night at Dinner, my son, soon to be 5, let it be known that his favorite [They Might Be Giants](http://www.tmbg.com) album is _Flood_.  My kids got into TMBG after we got them the band's first kids cd, _NO!_, followed by the amazing _Here Come The ABCs_ on both cd and DVD (*highly* recommended if you have kids).  A greatest hits compilation, _A User's Guide..._ rounds out the bunch which gives them a wider swath of material to judge TMBG, who now perform family shows, as well as the traditional 21 and over shows, while on tour.  Of couse his mention of Flood being his favorite only reminded me that I still need to burn him a copy of _Lincoln_, and also about the time I bought their first release, _[They Might Be Giants](http://www.answers.com/topic/they-might-be-giants-album)_ (pictured) on vinyl in **1986**. At the time it was only available on vinyl, so I had to go to a friend's house who had his parent's stereo setup with a good turntable so I could tape it, and then play it in my car. Yeah, that's funny, both in how long ago it was, and that I remember all of it.  As I've mentioned before, I love music, and even the act of visiting a music store is some religious experince for me, there's no telling what will happen that I'll be retelling some 20 years later...
