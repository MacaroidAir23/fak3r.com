![Thom Yorke of Radiohead in St. Louis, May 14, 2008](http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/yorkerockingout-thumb.jpg)We saw [Radiohead](http://radiohead.com/deadairspace/) last night, and they did not disappoint.  My wife and I weren't looking forward to the venue, a big shed and lawn 'pavilion' that everyone has now, but in the end it turned out to be a great night, with the location not being bad at all.  We last saw Radiohead at the same venue twelve years ago during their tour for _The Bends_, but it wasn't until just after that with the release of _OK Computer_ that I went completely ga-ga for them for life.  They had a huge chunk of material to choose from, and the show was amazing.  After two nice numbers from their recent release, they broke out Airbag and the place went nuts.  All the energy seemingly projected via the light show, which was really cool (don't think I've ever said that).  And look, I have to say this again and again, but dammit, Johnny Greenwood is so amazing, his composition, the sounds he gets from his guitar, and that shredding sound that he rips from it...outstanding-freaking-standing.  Of course he saved the best for last with Paranoid Android coming alive to close the show. I was happy to see the variety of concert goers, considering most were likely getting out of diapers when _OK computer_ came out!   The fact that this band has that much pull across a a swath of fans like that without radio play gives me hope for the future.  A great writeup of the show [on RFT](http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/atoz/2008/05/show_review_radiohead_at_the_v.php), be sure to follow their link to their well done [slideshow of pictures](http://riverfronttimes.com/slideshow/view/67200) (it's where I got the one above).  Now to find a soundboard or matrix sourced recording somewhere and we'll be all set.  Full set list after the jump.
