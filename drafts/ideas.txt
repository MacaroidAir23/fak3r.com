Is your employer running MitM SSL attacks on you?

After a network upgrade, I was unable to interact with github.com, a site that I use daily. The error I'd get was...

➜  infra_as_code_examples git:(master) ✗ git pull
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/rueedlinger/infra_as_code_examples.git/': server certificate verification failed. CAfile: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt CRLfile: none

This made me suspicious, so I followed the trail. Obviously we know that cert should be valid, so are we now blocked from accessing github.com, or do I need to important a new CA cert? Looking into it more:

* Connection #0 to host github.com left intact

So it looks as if SSL is being intercepted by the gateway, does this mean they were doing SSL decryption on outgoing traffic to * hosts? Using Chrome trying to browse github tells me there's an HSTS failure, which may answer that for me.

github.com has asked Chrome to block any certificates with errors, but the certificate that Chrome received during this connection attempt has an error.
Error type: HSTS failure
Subject: github.com
Issuer: WSG_SubCA
Public key hashes:

so the issuer here is WSG (assuming that means Websense Gateway) so it looks like we're using the feature described on the page: "New in Websense Content Gateway v7.8.1", specifically:

    Support for SSL (HTTPS) decryption, analysis, and re-encryption has been re-engineered for version 7.8.1" and inserting our own generated SSL and injecting that into the session.

In a presentation on this by a Websense employee, they specifically say:

• SSL decryption uses the Man In The Middle (MitM) method

Additionally, they show its functionality here:

Websense helps companies justify this with ideas like:

• SSL decryption improves adherence to organisational policies
– Access control
– Monitoring
– Reporting
• Improves organisational and user security
– Reduced risk of interception
– Adds the ability to control hosts and the Categories users can browse

and look - I totally get that, this is the companies' network, and they are responsible for defending it from malicious software entering the network... but people (users) don't know this, they are trained (by infosec experts like us) that if they use HTTPS and they see the 'Lock' that they have end-to-end encryption, and if they're running Windows within the company the new Websense CA cert is installed automagically so they don't know anything differently.
