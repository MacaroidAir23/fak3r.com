![ubuntustacked.png](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/ubuntustacked.png)The Ubuntu team is proud to announce the Beta Release of Ubuntu 6.10 - codenamed "Edgy Eft".  Featuring the new init system, Readahead, is dealing with speeding up boot times, Betas of the lastest Firefox and Gaim, new photo software F-Spot, Tomboy on by default, and for compwiz fiends (like me) we can play with AIGLX natively with Xorg 7.1 - nice. To Get Ubuntu 6.10 Beta, Download from a US mirrors here: [http://us.releases.ubuntu.com/6.10/](http://us.releases.ubuntu.com/6.10/) I have a fully working updated Dapper on my home workstation, but hey, I needs to have the latest, so I'll likely give this a go soon.
