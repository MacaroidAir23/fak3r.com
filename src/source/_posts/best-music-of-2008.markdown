![Thurston Moore has still got it](http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/f-thurstonmoore.jpg)It's time (well, past time, but...) for my yearly list list covering the best music releases of the year, 2008.  I continue the trend of discovering more music online through mp3 blogs, and social sites like [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/fak3r) and [blip.fm](http://blip.fm/fak3r) where you can not only see what people are listening to, but how their tastes spread out from that certain selection that you like.  This kind of RIYL (the old 'recommended if you like' suggestion from CMJ Journal) has always helped me jump from band to band and genre to genre, opening up far more than I would have had access to.  As I carve out my 'dj list' at blip.fm I build a 'station' where you can do this same kind of thing, and with last.fm you can peek over my shoulder and see what I just listened to and how many times I've listened to Mogwai, Elliot Smith or Girl Talk last year.  Remix, reuse, mashup, right?  I also have to mention that this was the year I bought my first McIntosh, no, not computer, [McIntosh](http://www.mcintoshlabs.com/), the legendary stereo amp specialists from the 60s.  After buying my [MA 6100](http://www.berners.ch/McIntosh/en/MA6100.htm) (ca. 1972 - as dated by a McIntosh employee) I simply had a new appreciation for the subtleties of my music, with acoustic, low-fi and jazz cds seeming to gain the most from the switch.  It happens like that, a new piece of upgraded hardware will change the sound I'm building, and I'll hear new things in my favorite old recordings.  (2009 may be the year of the speaker!)  Ok then, so here's my list, and as always, my list from the past years, going all the way back to 2001, can be found on my [Noise](http://fak3r.com/noise) page.  What selections below do you dig?  What did I miss?  Please, go on...
