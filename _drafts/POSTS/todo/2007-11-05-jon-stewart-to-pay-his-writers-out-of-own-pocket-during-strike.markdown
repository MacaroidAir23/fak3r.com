![Jon Stewart](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/s-jon-stewart-large.jpg)This is cool (and somewhat of a relief), Jon Stewart will be [paying his writers out of his own pocket during the writers strike](http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/mixed-media/2007/11/05/stewart-will-keep-striking-daily-writers-afloat). "_In a show of solidarity with his fellow scribes, the Daily Show host has told his writing staff that he will cover all their salaries for the next two weeks, according to a well-placed source. He has also vowed to do the same for writers on The Colbert Report. A Comedy Central spokesman referred my inquiry about this to Stewart's personal publicist, who has yet to respond. Stewart's intention, says the source, is to ensure his writers will face no financial hardship should the strike, which kicked off at 3 a.m. local time, conclude within that time frame._" I was wondering if we were going to have to endure weeks of reruns and loss of coverage that the strike would have brought, cool! Wonder what Colbert has planned.
