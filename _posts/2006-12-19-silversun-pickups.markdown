![Silversun Pickups](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/silversun_pickups.jpg)With all of the early Smashing Pumpkins comparisons to live down (if you ever heard [Gish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish) you know what I'm talking about), LA's [Silversun Pickups](http://fak3r.com/www.silversunpickups.com) (named after a package liquor store in the area) put forth a lot more rock than I was expecting.  Like Band of Horses earlier this year, my wife hipped me to this band during a Letterman performance, and it left me interested.  Here's the single from their long player that came out earlier this year called Carnavas.
