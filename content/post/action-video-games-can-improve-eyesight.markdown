![Video game eye test](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/gaming_eyesight.jpg)Ah, after plenty of [positive Wii news](http://fak3r.com/2007/02/20/fitness-experts-endorse-wii-for-health-benefits/), here's more great news about the [benefits of playing video games](http://pressesc.com/node/313/)!  "_Video games that contain high levels of action, such as Unreal Tournament, can actually improve your vision, according to a group of Researchers at the University of Rochester. In an article to be published in [Psychological Science](http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/journal.asp?ref=0956-7976), they have shown that people who played action video games for a few hours a day over the course of a month improved by about 20 percent in their ability to identify letters presented in clutterâ€”a visual acuity test similar to ones used in regular ophthalmology clinics. In essence, playing video game improves your bottom line on a standard eye chart._"  In the test, "Students had to quickly identify the orientation of the middle "T" -- Action game players could do it better."
