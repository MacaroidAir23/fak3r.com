![Mac Mini](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/mini-measured.jpg)Wowser, here’s vid of a Mac mini Duo, doing some [fast OS switching](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbt9upE6hpM&feature=Views&page=1&t=t&f=b).  It’s running OS X with [Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/) and [Virtue Desktops](http://virtuedesktops.info/) which allows it to run Windows XP and Red Hat 4 ES all at the same time.  The switching between the 3 OSs uses the ‘cube effect’ just like the fast user switching of OS X, and looks to be just as swift.  I think that’s about all I need to see, if I can have a Mac Mini Duo running a triple boot like that, I think I’ll be all set (for a few weeks).

**UPDATE**: it looks like it would only cost an additional [about 78$](http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.asp?Mfr%2BProductline=Apple%2BMac+mini&mfr=Apple&tabid=AM&model=Mac+mini+%28Intel+Core+Duo+-+1.66GHz%29&submit=Go) for a 512Meg RAM chip to bring this puppy up to 1G total.  OS X seems to ‘need’ at least 1G RAM in my experience, plus this would be way more than enough to run a few OSs at once, or at least the ones I need; OS X and Linux.  Looking around it seems that replacing the RAM is [quite the adventure](http://www.applefritter.com/Mac_Mini_Take_Apart_Guide)!  Time to find my tweezers.
