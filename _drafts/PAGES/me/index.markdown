I am a hacker, open source technologist at-large, sometimes writer and speaker. I've been honored to speak at [infosec](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security) conferences like [DEF CON](http://www.defcon.org), [SecureWorld](http://secureworldpost.secureworldexpo.com/) andÂ [SEMAFOR](http://konferencje.computerworld.pl/konferencje/semafor2012/zagadnienia.html) - while attending others such as [B-Sides](http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/36939448/BSidesLasVegas) in Las Vegas. I am an active memeber of the [EFF](http://eff.org) (Electronic Frontier Foundation), I lead and moderate discussions about electronic rights and civil liberties while educating users how their data is used by companies without their knowledge; things that are 'free' online, actually aren't free. In fact, most of my research over the past few years has focused more on companies weaknesses in protecting customer's data, and their failures in keeping that data private. Speaking engagements on earlier work dealth with system architecture in the global biodiversity realm, and slides of those are available on my [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/) account.

With over fifteen years experience with Linux and open source software, I know there's always another way to do it, so I'm constantly learning new techniques to solve technical challenges. I usually do this by hacking on my home servers, then blogging about my results here. So my blog has always served as a testing ground, and a place to organize my thoughts while allowing feedback for others, and myself to build off. I participate in open source development, and release all code I write on my [GitHub](http://github.org) account. I listen to music [constantly](http://www.last.fm/user/fak3r), hold a bachelor's degree in fine arts, am a practicing troublemaker and an accidental tourist. In general, I like to keep it real. If you have questions or comments, reach out and email me at:

Thanks.
