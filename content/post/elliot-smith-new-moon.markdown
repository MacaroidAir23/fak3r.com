![Elliot Smith](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/elliottsmithpromo.jpg)I've been reading a bunch of reviews about Elliot Smith's new release, New Moon while playing it on the iPod.  It's a compilation of mostly acoustic bsides and demos from his fertile period between 1995-1997 when he recorded for Kill Rock Stars, and includes gems that folks familiar with Elliot's music will enjoy uncovering.  As a whole, most reviews point new users away from this one, but highly recommend it for those familiar with his music, and I'll agree there.  If you've heard/seen Elliot before, pick this up, if not, go buy Either/Or and XO first.  This is the second release from Elliot since his death (queue the Tupac or Sublime jokes), but the last was the finishing up of the glorious From A Basement On A Hill, and this is simply a collection of seldom to never heard tunes from the period, so it's hardly the rehash you usually see.  Regardless, this set replaces crummy mp3s that I have of some of these, while putting them in perspective with their brethren.  I wish he could have seen it through, but like all artists their true measurement of their comes after their lives.  Gentle voice, familiar minor chord changes, brilliant writing, it's here for all to hear; thanks Elliot.  Close your eyes and enjoy the view of the new moon...
