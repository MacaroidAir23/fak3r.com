![Jimmac mouse curors](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/jimmac_xfree.jpg)So the only thing I don't love about my new job is the same old thing; you have to run Windows XP on the desktop.  Yeah, I'll give it a bit more time before I really start pushing to run Linux on the desktop, so until then it's my ongoing struggle to get XP to work the way I want it to (ie- more like Linux).  One simple way is to install the excellent Jimmac mouse cursor theme that's  the default for the majority of Linux distributions.  [Jakub Steiner](http://jimmac.musichall.cz/index.php) (aka Jimmac) is the famous designer of this set, and with a 3rd party app called CursorXP  , it's a snap to get them into XP. First grab the [Jimmac theme](http://www.wincustomize.com/skins.aspx?skinid=607&libid=25) created to work with CursorXP, then [Download and install CursorXP](http://www.download.com/CursorXP/3000-2317-10357248.html?tag=list)  and get into its config menu, which is a new tab under Settings > Mouse.  From the drop down list choose <Broswe>, point it to the theme and you're done.  You wouldn't think a change of mouse cursors would change the feel of a system so much, but these do; I feel more at home.  Even if you've never used Linux you'll still love this cursor set, try it, it's all free.
