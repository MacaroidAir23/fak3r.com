[![](http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/windows_linux_apple-300x87.png)](http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/windows_linux_apple.png)So while I realize this won't be of interest to the majority of people out there, to me it's very cool (something I would even blog about!)  So I'm in San Francisco last week meeting with developers and programmers from a variety of backgrounds; web 2.0 start-ups, .com verterans, non-profit and academic folk alike.  We're all sitting around a conference table, each one with a laptop, so you can see what's coming, here's the breakdown: 11 laptops, 4 running Apple's OSX, 4 running Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, Mandriva) and only 3 running Windows XP!  Again, it was a certain subset of folks, so I know that ratio won't hold up most places, even this year's DefCon in Las Vegas, but at that meeting things just clicked.  I even talked to some of the Devs running Linux and we have the same feelings about OSX, it's great, but it's just not as open or free as Linux is; at some point someone is making the call on how you're going to use the software and, for us, it just 'didn't fit' right.  Anyway, seeing that many like minded folks was very cool, I've not worked with people like that in the past, so to have this opportunity is a dream.
