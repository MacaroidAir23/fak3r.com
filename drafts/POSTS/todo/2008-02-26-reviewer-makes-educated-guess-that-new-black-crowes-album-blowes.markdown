![Thumbs down](http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/thumbs-down.jpg)While I don't look to Maxim for advice on buying music, it seems hilarious that one of their writers slammed the upcoming Black Crowes' release, giving it only ** 1/2 stars out of *****, [without even hearing the full album](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080226/ap_en_mu/music_black_crowes_maxim).  That's cold.  "_The band posted an exasperated statement on its Web site last week, saying the Maxim writer hadn't heard the entire album because advance copies were not available. The Cro__wes' manager, Pete Angelus, said the magazine explained that its review was an "educated guess." Maxim editorial director James Kaminsky responded Tuesday with this statement: "It is Maxim's editorial policy to assign star ratings only to those albums that have been heard in their entirety. Unfortunately, that policy was not followed in the March 2008 issue of our magazine and we apologize to our readers_."  Call me crazy, but I'm going to take an "educated guess" that the rest of the March 2008 Maxim (or any other issue) is not worth my time either.  ![2 1/2 stars](http://www.fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/25stars.gif)
