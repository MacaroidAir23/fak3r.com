This TED Talk from Eli Pariser covers his concept of [The Filter Bubble](http://www.thefilterbubble.com/), and is a must watch for anyone concerned about internet privacy and what's being done with personal data we're freely exposing to companies. "_Every year, thousands of entrepreneurs, change-makers, innovators and scientists gather in Long Beach, California for TED, the world’s leading thought conference. In 2011, the audience included executives from Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and many other Silicon Valley startups. So when Eli Pariser explained the filter bubble concept and then called on them from the main stage to change how they do business, it wasn’t at all clear how they’d react_."
