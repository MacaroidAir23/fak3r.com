![Shellac - Excellent Italian Greyhound](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/shellac-excellent_italian_greyhound.jpg)I've [written before](http://fak3r.com/2006/09/27/new-shellac-album-early-2007/) about Shellac, as they've been a favorite of mine for a long time.  I've only seen them on their fist tour, which may have been some 13 (?) years back, but their recorded work wears well.  They'll release their new record, _Excellent Italian Greyhound_, on June 05, 2007, their first since 2000's _1000 Hurts_.  I have an old friend in Austin who was a big Shellac fan, but that's about it.  They're a band you're either going to love, or hate, depending on your perspective of Steve Ablini (Big Black, Scratch Acid, Rapeman, as well as recording engineer and owner of [Electrical Audio](http://www.electrical.com/)) and, whose singing and guitar sounds are like no other.  When I was dating my wife I knew she was special as she accompanied me to a show of theirs, held at a cafeteria in the Washington University student union.  She didn't care for them then, and still doesn't, but she understands my love of music.  And that's just it, to me Shellac is some of the most original work out there, and again, after only releasing a scant of full lengths, the power of each stands on its own. The record's title is a [reference to drummer Todd Trainer's Italian Greyhound](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excellent_Italian_Greyhound), Uffizi.  For an excellent intro to the band you can [download a full show](http://www.transmission3000.com/bands/?r=shellac.html) from a UK appearance in 2002, or sample a track from it below.  Play loud.
