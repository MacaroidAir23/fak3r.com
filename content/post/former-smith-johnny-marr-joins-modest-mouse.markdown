![marr200.jpg](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/marr200.jpg)This is pretty amazing, I knew he was recording with the band for the new album, but apparently they got along pretty well.  "[Modest Mouse](http://www.modestmousemusic.com/) has been busy recording a new album, tentatively titled, **We Were Dead Before The Ship Even Sank**, with former Smiths guitarist [Johnny Marr](http://www.jmarr.com).  What began as a simple project helping Isaac Brock and Modest Mouse has turned into a full-time gig as Marr has officially joined the band. Brock was quoted as saying: "_He made a cautious commitment to write and record with us, and then the tighter we got, he was like, 'okay, let's tour too.'  Then he was pretty much a member of the band - not pretty much.  He's a full-blown member of the band.  It's really fuckin' nice._"  Yeah, that surely is fuckin' nice!  I've always rated The Smiths as one of my all time fav bands, and their music is still relevant, but while Morrissey has gone on to create his own art, Marr has bounced around from project to project never really catching on with anything.  Plus I've been a Modest Mouse fan for years now, so it's going to be really interesting to see where this takes their sound, especially after the major shift, that was successful at least according to critics.  For now, crank up that copy of [The Queen is Dead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen_Is_Dead) and wait.
