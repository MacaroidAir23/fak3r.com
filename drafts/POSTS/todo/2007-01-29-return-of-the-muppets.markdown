![Kermit](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/kermitxfg.jpg)I would love to see another [Muppets ](http://muppets.go.com/main.html)series, what in the day of _American Idol_, and all the other real(ly awful)ity TV that's out there, how cool would it be to see everyone again?  Plus, the [idea sounds funny](http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/01/24/will-the-muppets-final-return-to-primetime/): "...a brand new pilot for a Muppet mini-series is being passed around Disney, a spoof on mockumentary series like _The Office_ that has the Muppet gang getting back together to put on a new show after venturing off on their own to find new jobs. That plot actually sounds very similar to _The Muppets Take Manhattan_ . Word has it that the mini-series, if successful, could spawn a brand new primetime Muppet series."  It'd be sweet to watch with the kiddos, and then get the DVDs of _[The Muppet Show](http://www.amazon.com/Muppet-Show-Season-One-Special/dp/B0009ULBGS)_ that I remember watching every night when I was a kid; and yes, I still aspire to being one of those two old guys ([Statler & Waldorf](http://fak3r.com/Statler%20&%20Waldorf)) heckling with their smart assed comments from the balcony... "_You know, the older I get, the more I appreciate good music. _- _What's that got to do with what we just heard? _- _Nothing, just thought I'd mention it!"_
