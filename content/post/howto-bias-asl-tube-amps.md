 AV-20 DT AND AV-25 DT TUBE MONO POWER AMPLIFIERS. 

Bias adjustment instructions:
* A small slot-tip screwdriver and a voltmeter are required. 
* Install tubes and connect amplifier to loudspeaker.
* Voltmeter set at mV, connect (-) probe of the meter to chassis or loudspeaker ground.  
* For out put tube 1 (VB-1) connect (+) probe of the meter to TP-1 and adjust VR-1 until meter shows 330 mV. 
* For out put tube 2 (VB-2), connect (+) probe to TP-2 and adjust VR-2 until meter reads 330 mV. 
* Allow amplifier to warm up for 20 minutes and adjust bias for both tubes again. 
5% variations between each tubes bias readings is acceptable.

Bias should be checked each time output tubes are replaced or a defective tube is suspected.
