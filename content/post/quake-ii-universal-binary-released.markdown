![Quake II](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/q2_logo.gif)Anyone that knows me (or Chuck Bucket) knows that [Quake II](http://www.idsoftware.com/games/quake/quake2/) is my all time favorite online game.  I can’t even imagine the time I spent playing that game, I’m just glad it didn’t come out when I was in college, because then it would have just taken over everything.  As it was I spent plenty of late nights fragging away with friend and foe.  I fell in with a particular mod called Weapons Of Destruction back in 1997 or so, on a server out in Orange County, CA called DugDogs.  We’d always have a great time late at night, making friends who would email and talk back on Doug’s forum on the same server.  A virtual community that lived to tweak their systems and [configuration files](http://nettrash.com/users/kosh/wodconfig.htm) to give them the edge on the insult binds, a faster draw, or whatver would cause the most death, chaos and laughs.  Last year I even launched a [WOD Quake II Server](http://q2.fak3r.com/) online to allow for others to join in the fun.  I’ve played newer games, Return to Castle Wolfenstein being my favorite, but nothing matched the sheer excitement that Quake II (modded or not) would generate.  The ‘kill em all’ mantra just left you running down each coridor, aiming high and low around each corner.  So, why do I bring this up?  Someone has [ported the Quake II client to a Universal Binary](http://www.fruitz-of-dojo.de/php/download.php4?dlnr=6), so now it plays on OS X under the Intel Macs.  We know the Mac Mini’s graphics card is far superior to whatever Voodoo3 we used to play online with, so what fun it’ll be to drop this on a new Mini, configure the WOD mod, pop open a beer and head out looking for servers online…
