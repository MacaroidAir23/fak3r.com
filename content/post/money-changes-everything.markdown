[![The Smiths](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/1065988597_esmesmiths.jpg)](http://www.compsoc.man.ac.uk/~moz/pictures/thetube.png)Morrissey’s [recent interview](http://www.nme.com/news/morrissey/22518) during Austin’s Sxsw, stirred plenty of emotion of us old Smiths fans.  ”_Morrissey revealed that The Smiths were offered $5 million to play last year’s Coachella festival - and turned it down. Speaking at a press conference before his show at this year’s South by South West music festival (March 16), the singer explained that “money doesn’t come into it”. He added: “It never has. I do what I do because it’s all that I am_.”  Elsewhere Mozzer re-pins the blame of the Smiths implosion [back on Marr](http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002198233), ”_It was a fantastic journey. And then it ended. I didn’t feel we should have ended. I wanted to continue. [Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr] wanted to end it. And that was that_.”  I wish I could have gone to Sxsw this year to see him, (see a writeup of the gig in the Austin Cronicle [here](http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2006-03-17/music_phases68.html) - covering “Deep in the Heart of Texas”?  mp3 link anyone?) or even Tulsa last week, as _he knows I’d love to see him_, but it’s been some time.  The most recent miss was years ago in Austin, when I was left heartbroken the night before his scheduled gig, ”_The last time that Morrissey was scheduled to play Austin, in 2004, the gig was cancelled due to illness_.” Still, all looks bright for the future, Mozwise, as he continues to dust off old hits like “Stop Me…”, “Girlfriend in a Coma” and the like for new shows.  ”_This year his fans were treated to a 17-song set that mixed material from his new album with four Smiths classics. Explaining his decision include Smiths songs in his recent sets the singer said: “I didn’t play Smiths songs for a long time. But then I realised that those songs don’t belong to somebody else - nobody will sing them as with as much feeling as me and no-one will make them more meaningful than I will_.”  Here, here, now come and play Saint Louis Steven, it’s been since 1991 for hell’s sake!  _See you in far off places_ indeed.
