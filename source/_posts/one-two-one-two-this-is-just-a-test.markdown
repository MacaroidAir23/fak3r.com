Here's a post from [BloGTK](http://blogtk.sourceforge.net/index.php), basically a client app for Linux that allows me to post directly to my blog.  It's crazy simple to setup, but someone has posted a [walkthrough with screenies](http://www.robbyonrails.com/articles/2005/03/13/blogtk-and-typo).  I really dig Typo, very different from [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org/) that powers LTC, but of course with different goals.  That live search is it, go ahead and search, *bam* there it is.  Then after if finds something, delete the search, and *poof* the results disappear too!
