![Choicepoint](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/choicepoint.jpg)I'm very interested in Data security, and with more and more information being collected daily, it's going to be more of an issue in the future.  Here, the name synonymous with data loss, Choicepoint, covers [lessons learned since their big incident](http://www.baselinemag.com/article2/0,1540,1981660,00.asp).  Sounds like they have some good things in place, let's hope this model is mirrored by others before breaches and not after.  And speaking of, be sure to review the [this great site at Privacy Rights](http://www.privacyrights.org/ar/ChronDataBreaches.htm), "A Chronology of data breaches since the Choicepoint incident", an ongoing tally of loss of data.  So much for not writing down your password...
