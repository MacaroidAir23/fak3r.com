![Technorati](http://fak3r.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/masthead.png)**UPDATE**: check it to the right, you can now add fak3r.com to your Technorati favorites, or subscribe in a few different ways.  The email one is the easiest, you just get one email each day when there's an update; no muss, no fuss.

I'm now kickin' it with a new [Technorati Profile](http://www.technorati.com/claim/p9479ceabq) - which is something I'd been meaning to checkout. According to them I'm ranked as number 230,035...so there are a few before me, no matter, this is just another attempt to open up fak3r.com to more eyeballs, just for fun, not for profit.  So file this under one of those New Year's resolutions I guess, but put it in the column of 'achieved' goals.
